Or are they\ndifferent words? If these are different things, which is better – saving or investing?\nSuch a clarification is warranted since many individuals use the two terms\ninterchangeably.\n\n\n## The word \"saving\" originates from the same root as “safe”. The safety of money is of\ncritical importance here. Whereas, when one invests money, the primary objective\ntypically is to earn profits. The important point to note here is that there is a trade-off\nbetween risk and return.\n\n\n## —\n\n\n## The other difference is evident from the dictionary definition of \"saving\" - reduction\nin the amount of money used. This definition refers to reducing consumption so that\nsome money is saved. It is this saved money that can be invested. In other words,\nsaving and investing are not to be considered as two completely different things, but\ntwo steps of the same process – in order to invest money, one needs to save first. Thus,\nsaving precedes investing.\n\n\n## 1.1.1 Factors to evaluate savings and investment products\n\n\n# The three most important factors to evaluate investments are safety, liquidity, and\nreturns. In addition to these, there are few more parameters such as convenience,\nticket size (or the minimum investment required), taxability of earnings, tax deduction,\netc. These factors have been discussed below:\n\n\n## Safety: This begins with the safety of capital invested. However, one could stretch that\nto also include the degree of surety of income from investment. In order to understand\nthe safety of an investment, it is important to understand the risks involved.\n\n\n## 11",

    "page_content": "<!-- Page 12 -->\n\n\n# Liquidity: How easily can one liquidate the investment and convert it to cash? The\ndegree of ease is different across different categories, and even within the categories,\nthe same could be different across products. Sometimes, the nature of the product\ncould be such that selling it is difficult, whereas sometimes there could be some\noperational features, e.g. a lock-in for a certain period, after which one may be able to\nliquidate the investment; or a penalty for early exit. While such a penalty does not\nhamper liquidity, it only lowers the investment returns. Another aspect that one may\nalso want to look at is the divisibility. Is it possible to liquidate part of the investment\nor is it necessary to sell the whole thing?\n\n\n## Returns: As seen earlier in the definition of investments, the major purpose is to get\nsome returns from investment. Such returns may be in the form of regular (or periodic)\nincome, also known as current income; and capital appreciation, or capital gains.\n\n\n## The current income is receivable periodically, without having to sell the investment,\nwhereas the capital gains can be realized only when one sells the investment.\n\n\n## The exit charges, or penalty would bring down the returns, as seen earlier. Hence,\nwhenever there are any such charges for withdrawals (including early withdrawals),\nthe same must be considered as a trade-off between liquidity and returns.\n\n\n## Convenience: Any investment must be evaluated in terms of convenience with respect\nto investing, taking the money out - fully or partially, as well as the investor's ability to\nconveniently check the value of the investment, as well as to receive the income.\n\n\n## Ticket size: What is the minimum amount required for investment? There are some\navenues where an investor can start investing amounts as small as Rs. 50 or Rs. 100,\nwhereas some require more than Rs. 1 lakh, and sometimes more than Rs. 1 crore. This\nbecomes an important factor while taking a decision about selection of investment\noptions. At the same time, this must not be the only option. Some investors (though a\nvery small number) have started considering certain investments (requiring large\namounts), only because they could afford the same, without checking whether they\nneeded it, or if that was appropriate for their situation and goals.\n\n\n## Taxability of income: What one retains after taxes is what matters, and hence, taxation\nof the earnings is another important factor that one must consider. While looking at\nthe taxability of income, it is critical to evaluate various other factors, too, and not look\nat taxation in isolation. For example, some products may offer lower tax on investment\nreturns, but the safety also may be low. At the same time, there could be some\nproducts that may offer low tax on investment returns, only if the investor stays\ninvested for a certain term, or till the maturity of the product. In other words, if the\ninvestor sells the investment before maturity (or a certain minimum period), the\ninvestment returns may be taxable.\n\n\n## 12",

    "page_content": "<!-- Page 13 -->\n\n\n# Tax deduction: A related matter is the tax deduction that may be available in case of\ncertain products. Such a deduction effectively increases the return on investment,\nsince the same is calculated after factoring the net amount invested.\n\n\n## However, where a deduction is available, the product may have a lock-in period of\ncertain years. Once again, this is a trade-off between liquidity and tax deduction.\n\n\n## The above discussion offers a good framework for evaluation of savings and\ninvestment products. However, as mentioned earlier, no factor should be seen in\nisolation. One also must consider the investor's situation while evaluating the avenues.\n\n\n# 1.2 Different Asset Classes\n\n\n## Various investment avenues can be grouped in various categories, called asset classes.\nAn asset class is a grouping of investments that exhibit similar characteristics. There\nare four broad asset categories or asset classes, and then there are various\nsubcategories, within each of these. The four broad categories- Real estate,\nCommodities, Equity and Fixed income.\n\n\n## Out of these, real estate and commodities are also called real assets, whereas equity\nand debt are called financial assets. The real assets are available in physical form,\nwhereas the other two would only be available in financial form.\n\n\n## Below is a discussion on the characteristics of each of the four asset categories, along\nwith the pros and cons.\n\n\n## 1.2.1 Real estate\n\n\n## Real estate is considered as the most important and popular among all the asset\nclasses. However, the popularity of this asset category is largely because of a reason\nnot related to investment. For those who have bought their own houses, it is the\nlargest expense in life. The word used here is “expense”, and not “investment\". This\nwould be elaborated later, but it is pertinent to mention here that in majority of cases,\nindividuals purchase for self-occupation. This should not be considered as investment,\nsince selling the same may have a negative impact on one's lifestyle.\n\n\n## Real estate could be further classified into various categories, viz., residential real\nestate, land, commercial real estate, etc.\n\n\n## As an asset category, real estate exhibits certain traits, some of which are listed as\nunder:\n\n- Location is the most important factor impacting the performance of investment in\nreal estate\n\n\n## 13",

    "page_content": "<!-- Page 14 -->\n\n- Real estate is illiquid\n- It is not a divisible asset\n- One can invest in physical real estate, as well as in financial form\n- Apart from capital appreciation, it can also generate current income in form of rents\n• In case of real estate, the transaction costs, e.g. brokerage charges, registration\ncharges, etc. are quite high. This would bring down the return on investment.\n- The cost of maintenance of the property, as well as any taxes payable must be\nadjusted before calculating the return on investment, something that many\nindividual investors do not. These expenses are also quite high, and cannot be\nignored.\n\n\n## 1.2.2 Commodities\n\n\n## This is another asset category that people at large are familiar in various ways. On a\nregular basis, people consume many commodities, e.g. agricultural commodities like\nspices; petroleum products such as petrol and diesel; or metals like gold and silver.\nHowever, it is not possible to invest in most of these, as many of these are either\nperishable and hence cannot be stored for long, or storage of the same could take a\nlot of space, creating different kind of difficulties.\n\n\n## Though, there are commodities derivatives available on many commodities, it may not\nbe wise to call these \"investments\" for two reasons, (1) these are leveraged contracts,\ni.e. one can take large exposure with a small of money making it highly risky and (2)\nthese are normally short term contracts, whereas the investors' needs may be for a\nlong term.\n\n\n## On the other hand, there are at least two commodities that many investors are quite\nfamiliar with as investment avenues, viz., gold, and silver.\n\n\n## When someone invests in these commodities, the prices are almost in sync across the\nworld. It is easy to understand the prices of gold and silver across countries by simply\nlooking at the foreign exchange rate between the two countries' currencies, and\nmaking adjustments for various costs and restrictions imposed by any of the countries.\nIn this manner, these two are globally accepted assets.\n\n\n# Both these commodities have been used as investments or storage of value for long.\nIn fact, the history of currency would be incomplete without mention of these two.\nGold has also been considered by many as a safe haven asset. In case of failure of an\neconomy, or a currency, gold is considered to be the final shelter. However, the\nopposite camp also comes with very strong arguments. Many currencies across the\nworld were pegged to the gold reserves available with the central bank of the country\n\n\n## 14",

And still, most of the central banks hold gold in their reserves.\n\n\n## An investor in these commodities would have to count only on capital appreciation,\nsince these do not generate any current income.\n\n\n# Gold and silver come in varying degrees of purity. Each one can be bought at different\nprices from the market. However, for a large majority of investors it is almost\nimpossible to make out the level of purity. If we opt for purity certificate, the cost goes\nup and without one, the risk of getting lower quality metal is high.\n\n\n## 1.2.3 Fixed income\n\n\n## When someone borrows money, one has to return the principal borrowed to the\nlender in the future. There could also be some interest payable on the amount\nborrowed. There are various forms of borrowing, some of which are through\nmarketable instruments like bonds and debentures².\n\n\n## There are many issuers of such papers, e.g. Companies, Union Government, State\nGovernments, Municipal Corporations, banks, financial institutions, public sector\nenterprises, etc.\n\n\n## Many bonds pay regular interest, thus the investors can expect current income. At the\nsame time, if someone has invested at the time of issuance of the bond and hold the\nsame till maturity, in almost all cases, there would be no capital gains. On the other\nhand, a transaction through secondary market – whether at the time of buying or at\nthe time of selling, or both – may result into capital gains or losses.\n\n\n## Bonds are generally considered to be safer than equity, which we would discuss next.\nHowever, these are not totally free from risks. These risks will be discussed in detail\nlater in the chapter.\n\n\n## Bonds can be classified into subcategories on the basis of issuer type i.e. issued by the\ngovernment or corporates or on the basis of the maturity date (short term bonds (ideal\nfor liquidity needs), medium term bonds, and long term bonds (income generation\nneeds).\n\n\n## 1.2.4 Equity\n\n\n# This is the owner's capital in a business.

When one buys the shares of a company through secondary market, the\nshare price could be high or low in comparison to the fair price.\n\n\n# Historically, equity investing has generated returns in excess of inflation, which means\nthe purchasing power of one's money has increased over the years. It has also\ndelivered higher returns than other investment avenues, most of the times, if one\nconsiders long investment periods.\n\n\n## Apart from long term capital appreciation, equity share owners may also receive\ndividends from the company. Such dividends are shared out of the profit that the\ncompany has generated from its business operations. If the company does really well,\nthe dividends tend to grow over the years.\n\n\n## To sum up, equity share prices generally fluctuate a lot, often without regard to the\nbusiness fundamentals. However, over long periods of time, the share prices follow\nthe fortunes of the firm. If the profits of the company continue to grow over the years,\nthe share price follows.\n\n\n## There are similarities and differences between the various asset categories.\n\n\n## Investments in equity and bonds can be done only in financial form, whereas one can\nbuy the other two assets, viz., real estate and commodities either in financial or in\nphysical form. It is this physical form that gives a feeling of safety to many. Anything\nthat is tangible is perceived to be safer than something intangible.\n\n\n## Real estate and commodities differ from equity and bonds in another way, too. These\ncould be bought as investment or for consumption purposes. For example, one may\ninvest in a residential property and give it on rent to generate income. This is\ninvestment. At the same time, one may also buy a flat to live in – for residential\npurpose. Such a self-occupied house may not be an investment. A similar logic may be\napplied to gold and silver by checking whether one has invested in the metal or bought\nthe same for personal use.\n\n\n## When someone invests in equity shares, part of the profits made by the company may\nbe shared with the investor. With a careful analysis of various equity shares, it is\npossible to receive a periodic income (though without any guarantee about how much\nwould one receive, and whether one receives anything at all). Similarly, a real estate\ncould be given on rent to generate intermittent cash flow. Bonds pay interest income.\nIt is the commodities where such intermittent cash flow is not generated.\n\n\n# Investor in equity, real estate and commodities is an owner of the asset, whereas an\ninvestor in bonds has lent money to someone. In such a case, the lender's receipts—\nbe it interest payments or return of principal amount invested - are agreed at the time\nof the issue of such instruments. In all the other three cases, the investor's cashflows\n\n\n## 16",

To that extent, the future returns from these assets, which\nmay also be called ownership assets, would be highly uncertain in comparison to the\nlending assets like bonds or fixed deposits.\n\n\n# While the above discussion was about the characteristics of various asset classes, and\ncertain differences across the asset categories, the same must be seen from another\nperspective, too. While one may buy equity shares listed in India in Indian Rupees, one\ncan also invest in shares of various companies listed outside India. This provides\nexposure to another currency. For example, an investor buying the shares of a\ncompany listed on the London Stock Exchange is exposed to the fortunes of the\ncompany, as well as the change in exchange rate between US Pound and Indian Rupee.\n\n\n## Similarly, one could also invest in bonds denominated in various currencies other than\nIndian Rupee, and one could also buy real estate abroad.\n\n\n## These are called International assets. However, one must understand the basic nature\nof the asset class as discussed earlier, and then try to assess the impact of currency\nfluctuation on these investments.\n\n\n# Different investment avenues can be categorized into different asset category as can\nbe seen from the illustration in Table 1.1:\n\n\n## Table 1.1 Investment avenues classified under different asset categories\n\n\n## Equity\n\n- Bluechip Companies\n- Mid-sized companies\n- Small-sized companies\n- Unlisted Companies\n- Foreign Stocks\n- Equity Mutual Funds\n\n\n## Fixed Income\n\n\n## Fixed deposit with a bank\n\n- Recurring deposit with a\nbank\n- Endowment Policies\n- Moneyback Policies\n- Public Provident Fund\n\n\n# Sukanya Samriddhi\nYojana (SSY)\n\n- Senior Citizens' Savings\nScheme (SCSS)\n- Post office Monthly\n\n\n## Income Scheme\n\n\n## Recurring deposit with a\n\n\n## post office\n\n- Company fixed deposit\n\n\n## Debentures/bonds\n\n\n# Debt Mutual Funds\n\n\n## 17",

Many of the things that we need, and\nthings we aspire for cost money. The needs could be now or sometime in the future.\n\nWhen it comes to money, we all have four basic needs.\n\n\n## 1.3.1 Transaction needs\n\n\n## The day-to-day life involves many transactions involving money. There could be\nincome in the form of earning through salary, business income, investment income,\nrent from house property, etc.. On the other hand, there are expenses for day to day\nliving, or entertainment, or purchase of luxury items, or even charitable contributions.\nAll these involve transactions.\n\nThese needs can be met with the help of the banking system.\n\n\n## 1.3.2 Protection needs\n\n\n## Since most individuals depend on the earning (income) of one or members of the\nfamily to fund their current expenses and financial goals, they may get into financial\ndifficulties if the income of one of the earning members stops prematurely. This may\nhappen on account of death of the earning member or health issues.\n\nLife and health insurance companies provide solutions to tackle such situations.\n\n\n## 1.3.3 Investment needs\n\n\n## The income and expenses that were discussed above may or may not be exactly\nmatched.

At the same time, every once in a while there are\nexpenses that one has to incur, which are far more than the income for the period.\n\n\n## These needs can be met by investing the regular monthly surplus in some investment\nproducts.\n\n\n## 1.3.4 Retirement needs\n\n\n## This is a phase of life when the income stops, but the expenses continue. These\nexpenses can be funded through the savings and investments one has accumulated\nthrough the working life. This need is mostly taken care of through the investment\nproducts as mentioned above. However, the approach to retirement needs to be\ndifferent from the other investment needs.\n\n\n## There are primarily two phases in retirement, (i) preretirement phase, which is also\ncalled the accumulation phase; and (ii) postretirement phase, which is also known as\nthe distribution phase. In the former, one can use various investment products;\nhowever, it is the distribution phase, where many different products like annuities\nwould come in to the picture.\n\n\n## 1.4 Different types of financial goals\n\n\n## There are numerous examples of such financial goals. Among the most common are\nfunding a child's education, cost of the marriage of one's son or daughter, funding the\nlifestyle in retirement, buying a vehicle, buying or renovating one's house, taking a big\nvacation. At the same time, there could be some not-so-common ones like starting\none's own business, or taking a sabbatical from work and fund one's higher education.\n\n\n## Goal setting is a very important exercise, while planning for investments. As seen\nabove, all the financial goals are about the need of money that cannot be fulfilled\nthrough the inflow at that time. While the expenses for the goal may be high or low,\nthe income (from salary, professional fees, etc.) may be less than the amount required\nto fund the goal. This is where money needs to be withdrawn from the investments –\nin other words, this is why one needs to invest the money.\n\n\n## The first step in goal setting is to identify these events in life. After identifying the\nevents, one needs to assign priorities — which of these are more important than the\nothers. Retirement, or children's education fall into the responsibilities category,\nwhereas a grand vacation maybe a good-to-have goal. Having said that, it is only the\nindividual and the family that can decide which is which. A financial advisor or a mutual\nfund distributor may only guide and help one take an appropriate decision. At the same\ntime, the role of such an intermediary could be very important.\n\n\n## 19",

Take for example, if someone is planning to buy a house, one\nneeds to decide the type of house one wants, as well as the location. These inputs\nwould help arrive at approximate cost. After that one needs to decide by when one\nwould like to buy this. Both the timeline and amount are critical for one to be able to\nplan to achieve the goal.\n\n\n## Such an exercise allows one to classify the goals in terms of the timeline – are the goals\nin the near term, or far in the future?\n\n\n## 1.4.1 Short term needs versus Long Term Goals\n\n\n## The retirement goal can be broken into two parts – accumulating a sum for retirement,\nand then taking income out of the corpus thus accumulated.\n\n\n# Another look at the two approaches to classifying the goals indicates that the goals can\nbe placed in the following matrix:\n\n\n# Critically important\n(responsibilities\n\n\n## Dreams\n\n\n## or\n\n\n# Good-to-\nhave\n\n\n## needs)\n\n\n## Immediate\n\n\n## term\n\n\n## Near term\n\n\n## Medium\n\n\n## term\n\n\n## Long term\n\n\n## The next step would be to assign amount to the financial goals. In the process of\nplanning, this is an important question: How much would it cost? Well, this question\nmust be answered in terms of amount needed when the goal is due. In such a case, the\ncosts are quite likely to move up. Such a rise in the cost of the goals is called inflation\nwith respect to the goal value.\n\n\n## Inflation adjustment for the goal values is critical, without which the entire planning\ncan go haywire. The cost of education has been going up at a very fast pace over the\nlast few decades.\n\n\n# Case Study: Sapna's higher education:\n\n\n# Sapna is an 8-year-old girl. Her parents want to plan for her higher education. Assume\nthat the estimated cost of her higher education is Rs. 10 lacs (in today's price), whereas\nSapna would go to college 10 years later. If the inflation in college fees is expected to\n\n\n## 20\n\n\n## 20\n\n\n<!-- Page 21 -->\n\n\n# be 8% p.a., her parents need to provide for Rs. 21.59 lakh in 10 years, approximately.3\nThere are too many assumptions involved here-the course Sapna would pursue, the\ncost of the education, and the inflation. However, one needs to start with some\nassumptions to start. Else, the parents may plan to accumulate Rs. 10 lacs (today's cost\nof education), which would be grossly insufficient.\n\n\n## Inflation has a long term impact, and hence while planning for funding all the long term\ngoals, one must consider inflation in the cost of the goal. On the other hand, the\nimmediate term and near term goals may not have a big impact due to changes in\nprice.\n\n\n## As mentioned earlier, inflation is the rise in prices of various products, and services\nconsumed. If the inflation is 6% p.a., the household expenses would be higher a year\nlater in comparison to today's cost of living. If a family's monthly expenses are Rs.\n30,000 currently, they would be spending Rs.31,800 next year if the inflation is 6%. This\ndoes not look like much, but if the inflation stays at the same level, this family's\nmonthly expenses would cross Rs. 53,000 after 10 years; and Rs. 96,000 after 20 years.\n\n\n## 1.5 Role of mutual funds in achieving different financial goals\n\n\n## As discussed earlier, investors need to invest our money from time to time. These\ninvestments can be made in various financial instruments ranging from Government\nsponsored schemes to bank fixed deposits to company debentures to shares of\ncompanies or real estate properties of even precious metals like gold or silver.\n\n\n## One option is to manage the investments oneself. That would involve finding the right\ninvestments and carrying out the related research and administration work. The other\noption is to outsource the entire job to a professional or a company engaged in such a\nbusiness.\n\n\n## Mutual fund is that second option – it is managed by a team of professionals, known\nas the asset management company. This is what really needs to be understood. By\nchoosing to invest through mutual funds, one is not investing in alternative investment\noptions, but only changing the way of investing money. The entire job of investing is\noutsourced to a professional firm.\n\n\n## So, the next logical question is: \"which of the two choices is better - investing oneself\nor taking professional help to manage my investments?\"\n\n\n# This question should be broken down into three components:\n\n- Can one do the job oneself?\n\n3 Note: Inflation numbers are taken based on random assumptions, and only for illustration purposes.\n\n\n## 21",

Practically, one does not\ninvest in mutual fund but invests through mutual funds. However, we hear of\n“investing in mutual funds” or “investing in mutual fund schemes”. While that is fine\nfor the purpose of discussions, technically it is not correct. As a mutual fund distributor,\nit is critical to understand the difference between the two concepts.\n\n\n## When someone says that one has invested in a mutual fund scheme, often, the scheme\nis perceived to be competing with the traditional instruments of investment, viz. equity\nshares, debentures, bonds, etc. The reality is that one invests in these instruments\nthrough a mutualfund scheme. In other words, through investment in a mutual fund, an\ninvestor can get access to equities, bonds, money market instruments and/or other\nsecurities, that may otherwise be unavailable to them and avail of the professional fund\nmanagement services offered by anasset management company.\n\n\n## Thus, an investor does not get a different product, but gets a different way of investing.\nThe difference lies in the professional way of investing, portfolio diversification, and a\nregulated vehicle.\n\n\n## Mutual fund is a vehicle (in the form of a “trust”) to mobilize money from investors, to\ninvest in different markets and securities, in line with stated investment objectives. In\nother words, through investment in a mutual fund, an investor can get access to\nequities, bonds, money market instruments and/or other securities, that may\notherwise be unavailable to them and avail of the professional fund management\nservices offered by an asset management company.\n\n\n## 2.1.1 Role of Mutual Funds\n\n\n# The primary role of mutual funds is to help investors in earning an income or building\ntheir wealth, by investing in the opportunities available in securities markets. It is\npossible for mutual funds to structure a scheme for different kinds of investment\n\n\n## 25",

Various\ncategories of schemes are called \"funds\". In order to ensure consistency with what is\nexperienced in the market, this workbook goes by the industry practice. However,\nwherever a difference is required to be drawn, the scheme offering entity is referred to\nas \"mutual fund\" or \"the fund\".\n\n\n## The money that is raised from investors, ultimately benefits governments, companies\nand other entities, directly or indirectly, for funding of various projects or paying for\nvarious expenses. The projects that are facilitated through such financing, offer\nemployment to people; the income they earn helps them buy goods and services\noffered by other companies, thus supporting projects of these goods and services\ncompanies. Thus, overall economic development is promoted.\n\n\n## As a large investor, the mutual funds can keep a check on the operations of the\ninvestee company, and their corporate governance and ethical standards.\n\n\n## The mutual fund industry itself offers livelihood to a large number of employees of\nmutual funds, distributors, registrars and various other service providers.\n\n\n## Higher employment, income and output in the economy boosts the revenue collection\nof thegovernment through taxes and other means. When these are spent prudently, it\npromotes further economic development and nation-building.\n\n\n## Mutual funds can also act as a market stabilizer, in countering large inflows or outflows\nfromforeign investors. Mutual funds are therefore viewed as a key participant in the\ncapital marketof any economy.\n\n\n## 2.1.2 Investment Objectives of Mutual Funds\n\n\n## Mutual funds seek to mobilize money from all possible investors. Various investors\nhave different investment preferences and needs. In order to accommodate these\npreferences, mutual funds mobilize different pools of money. Each such pool of money\nis called a mutual fund scheme.\n\n\n## Every scheme has a pre-announced investment objective. Investors invest in a mutual\nfund scheme whose investment objective reflects their own needs and preference.\n\n\n## The primary objective of various schemes stems from the basic needs of an investor,\nviz., safety, liquidity, and returns. Let us look at some examples of investment\nobjectives (Table 2.1), as taken from the scheme information documents of certain\nmutual fund schemes.\n\n\n## 26\n\n\n## 26",

Since mutual funds are\ninvestment vehicles that invest in different asset categories, the mutual fund scheme\nreturnswould depend on the returns generated from these underlying investments.\nHence, once the investment objective is finalised, the mutual fund scheme's\ninvestment policy is arrived at. This is to achieve the investment objective. The\ninvestment policy includes the scheme's asset allocation and investment style.\n\n\n## A mutual fund scheme with the objective of providing liquidity would invest in money\nmarketinstruments or in debt papers of very short-term maturity. At the same time, a\nmutual fund scheme that aims to generate capital appreciation over long periods\nwould invest in equity shares. This would reflect in the scheme's asset allocation, which\nwould be disclosed in the Scheme Information Document (SID). However, even within\nthe same asset category, the fund manager may adopt different styles, e.g., growth\nstyle or value style; or different levelsof portfolio concentration e.g., focused fund or\ndiversified fund.\n\n\n## The scheme's investment policy would disclose two aspects-asset allocation and\ninvestment style.\n\n\n## 2.1.4 Important Concepts in Mutual Funds Units\n\n\n## The investment that an investor makes in a scheme is translated into a certain\nnumber of Units' in the scheme. Thus, an investor in a scheme is issued units of the\nscheme.\n\n\n## Face Value\n\n\n## Typically, every unit has a face value of Rs. 10. The face value is relevant from an\naccounting perspective.\n\n\n## Unit Capital\n\n\n## The number of units issued by a scheme multiplied by its face value (Rs. 10) is the\ncapital of the scheme—its Unit Capital.\n\n\n## Recurring Expenses\n\n\n## The fees or commissions paid to various mutual fund constituents come out of the\nexpenses charged to the mutual fund scheme. These are known as recurring expenses.\nThese expenses are charged as a percentage to the scheme's assets under\nmanagement (AUM). The scheme expenses are deducted while calculating the NAV.\n\n\n## 28",

The NAV is\nalso the net realizablevalue per unit in case the scheme is to be liquidated-how much\nmoney could be generated ifall the holdings of the scheme are sold and converted into\ncash.\n\n\n# Assets Under Management\n\n\n## The sum of all investments made by investors in the mutual fund scheme is the entire\nmutual fund scheme's size, which is also known as the scheme's Assets Under\nManagement (AUM). This can also be obtained by multiplying the current NAV with the\ntotal units outstanding. The relative size of mutual fund companies/asset management\ncompanies is assessed by their assets under management (AUM). When a scheme is\nfirst launched, assets under management is the amount mobilized from investors.\nThereafter, if the scheme performs well then, its AUM goes up and vice versa.\n\n\n## Further, if the scheme is open to receiving money from investors even post-NFO, then\nsuch contributions from investors boost the AUM. Conversely, if the scheme pays any\nmoney to the investors, either as a dividend or as consideration for buying back the units\nof investors, theAUM falls. Dividend option of schemes is now called Income Distribution\ncum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) option.\n\n\n## Mark to Market\n\n\n## The process of valuing each security in the investment portfolio of the scheme at its\ncurrent market value is called Mark to Market (MTM). The mark-to-market valuation\nis done on a daily basis for the calculation of daily NAV of a mutual fund scheme. This\nresults in daily fluctuations in the NAVs of all schemes.\n\n\n## 2.1.5 Advantages of Mutual Funds for Investors\n\n\n## Professional Management\n\n\n## Mutual funds offer investors the opportunity to earn an income or build their wealth\nthrough the professional management of their investible funds. There are several\naspects to such professional management viz. investing in line with the investment\nobjective, investing based on adequate research, and ensuring that prudent investment\nprocesses are followed.\n\nInvesting in the securities markets will require the investor to open and manage\n\n\n## 29\n\n\n## 29",

Mutual fund investment simplifies the process of investing and holding\nsecurities.\n\n\n# The fund management function is not restricted to research and selection of securities\nto construct a portfolio of investments, but also to take care of various administrative\ntasks like collection of corporate benefits (for example interest payments, dividends,\nrights issues, buybacks, etc.), or follow up on the same.\n\n\n## The calculation and publishing of NAV on a daily basis means that the accounting of the\nentire portfolio is done on a daily basis. The investor managing one's portfolio\nindependently would need to take too much efforts to take care of this part. All these\nbenefits come at a very low cost and is available even for the smallest investments.\nFurther, the expenses charged for professional management of funds are quite\nreasonable.\n\n\n# Affordable Portfolio Diversification\n\n\n## Investing in the units of a scheme provides investors the exposure to a range of securities\nheld in the investment portfolio of the scheme in proportion to their holding in the\nscheme. Thus, an investor can get proportionate ownership in a diversified investment\nportfolio even for a small investment of Rs. 500 in a mutual fund scheme.\n\n\n## With diversification, an investor ensures that “all the eggs are not in the same basket”.\nConsequently, the investor is less likely to lose money on all the investments at the same\ntime. Thus, diversification helps reduce the risk in investment. In order to achieve the\nsame level ofdiversification as a mutual fund scheme, investors will need to set apart\nseveral lakhs of rupees. Instead, they can achieve the diversification through an\ninvestment of less than thousand rupees in a mutual fund scheme.\n\n\n## Economies of Scale\n\n\n## Pooling of large sums of money from many investors makes it possible for the mutual\nfund to engage professional managers for managing investments. Individual investors\nwith small amounts to invest cannot, by themselves, afford to engage such professional\nmanagement.\n\n\n## Large investment corpus leads to various other economies of scale. For instance, costs\nrelatedto investment research and office space gets spread across investors. Further,\nthe higher transaction volume makes it possible to negotiate better terms with\nbrokers, bankers and other service providers.\n\n\n## Mutual funds give the flexibility to an investor to organize their investments according\nto their convenience. Direct investments may require a much higher investment\n\n\n## 30\n\n\n<!-- Page 31 -->\n\n\n# amount than what many investors may be able to invest. For example, an effectively\ndiversified equity portfolio may require a large outlay. Mutual funds offer the same\nbenefits at a much lower investmentvalue since it pools small investments by multiple\ninvestors to create a large fund. Similarly, the Income distribution cum capital\nwithdrawal (i.e. erstwhile dividend option) and growth options of mutual funds allow\ninvestors to structure the returns from the fund in the way that suits their\nrequirements.\n\n\n## Thus, investing through a mutual fund offers a distinct economic advantage to an\ninvestor ascompared to direct investing in terms of cost saving.\n\n\n## Transparency\n\n\n## An investor is well served if relevant information is available on time. Availability of\nsuch information is critical for making an informed investment decision. The structure\nof the mutual funds and the regulations by SEBI have ensured that investors get such\ntransparency about their investments. There are three essential places from where the\ninvestor can get enough information for making informed decisions, viz., scheme\nrelated documents (SID, SAI, and KIM), portfolio disclosures, and the NAV of the\nscheme. Incidentally, even a prospective investor can access all this information.\n\n\n## Liquidity\n\n\n## At times, investors in financial markets are stuck with a security for which they can't\nfind a buyer-worse, at times they can't find the company they invested in. Such\ninvestments, whose value the investor cannot easily realize in the market, are\ntechnically called illiquid investments and may result in losses for the investor.\n\n\n## Investors in a mutual fund scheme can recover the market value of their investments,\nfrom the mutual fund itself. Depending on the structure of the mutual fund scheme,\nthis would be possible, either at any time, or during specific intervals, or only on the\nclosure of the scheme. Schemes, where the money can be recovered from the mutual\nfund only on the closure of the scheme, are compulsorily listed on a stock exchange.\nIn such schemes, the investor can sell the units through the stock exchange platform\nto recover the prevailing value of the investment.\n\n\n## If a 'material' development takes place related to investments in a mutual fund scheme,\nthensuch information is made available on time. This helps an investor to take an\nappropriate action, including taking out the money from a mutual fund scheme. This\ncombination of transparency and liquidity enhances the safety.\n\n\n## 31",

If the same income\nwere to be earned by the investor directly, then tax may have to be paid in the same\nfinancial year.\n\n\n# Mutual funds offer options, whereby the investor can let the money grow in the\nscheme for several years. By selecting such options, it is possible for the investor to\ndefer the tax liability. This helps investors to legally build their wealth faster than would\nhave been the case if theywere to pay tax on the income each year.\n\n\n## Tax benefits\n\n\n## Specific schemes of mutual funds (Equity Linked Savings Schemes) give investors the\nbenefit of deduction of the amount subscribed (up to Rs. 150,000 in a financial year\nunder Section 80C of the old tax regime), from their income that is liable to tax. This\nreduces their taxable income, and thereforethe tax liability.\n\n\n## Convenient Options\n\n\n## The options offered under a scheme allow investors to structure their investments in line\nwith their liquidity preference and tax position.\n\n\n## There are also transaction conveniences like the ability to withdraw only part of the\nmoney from the investment account, the ability to invest the additional amount to\nthe account, setting up systematic transactions, etc.\n\n\n## Investment Comfort\n\n\n## Once an investment is made with a mutual fund, they make it convenient for the\ninvestor to make further purchases with very little documentation. This simplifies\nsubsequent investment activity.\n\n\n## Regulatory Comfort\n\n\n## The regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), has mandated strict\nchecks andbalances in the structure of mutual funds and their activities. Mutual fund\ninvestors benefit from such protection.\n\n\n## Systematic Approach to Investments\n\n\n# Mutual funds also offer facilities that help investors invest amounts regularly through\na Systematic Investment Plan (SIP); or withdraw amounts regularly through a\nSystematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP); or move money between different kinds of\n\n\n## 32",

Such systematic approaches\npromote investment discipline, which is useful in long-term wealth creation and\nprotection.\n\n\n# 2.1.6 Limitations of Mutual Fund\n\n\n# Lack of Portfolio Customization\n\n\n## Some brokerages and asset management firms offer Portfolio Management Services\n(PMS) to large investors. In a PMS, the investor has better control over what\nsecurities are bought and sold on his behalf. The investor can get a customized\nportfolio in case of PMS.\n\n\n## On the other hand, a unit-holder in a mutual fund is just one of several thousand\ninvestors in a scheme. Once a unit-holder has bought into the scheme, investment\nmanagement is left to the fund manager (within the broad parameters of the\ninvestment objective). Thus, the unitholder cannot influence what securities or\ninvestments the scheme would invest into.\n\n\n## Choice Overload\n\n\n## There are multiple mutual fund schemes offered by several mutual fund houses and\nmultiple options within those schemes which makes it difficult for investors to choose\nbetween them.Greater dissemination of industry information through various media\nand availability of professional advisors or mutual fund distributors in the market helps\ninvestors handle this overload.\n\n\n## In order to overcome this choice overload, SEBI has introduced the categorisation of\nmutual funds to ensure uniformity in characteristics of similar type of schemes\nlaunched by different mutual funds. This would help investors to evaluate the\ndifferent options available before making an informed decision to invest.\n\n\n# No Control Over Costs\n\n\n## All the investor's money is pooled together in a scheme. Costs incurred for managing\nthe scheme are shared by all the Unit-holders in proportion to their holding of units in\nthe scheme. Therefore, an individual investor has no control over the costs in a\nscheme.\n\n\n## SEBI has however imposed certain limits on the expenses that can be charged to any\nscheme. These limits, which vary with the size of assets and the nature of the scheme,\nare discussed later. However, at the same time, it should be noted that the market\nforces also push the costdown, and there are many schemes that operate at expenses\nmuch lower than the limits allowed by the regulator. This aspect turns out to be\nadvantageous for investors.\n\n\n## 33",

That itself protects the interests of the\ninvestors. A mutual fund is not a guaranteed return product. It is just another way of\nmanaging money-except that instead of an investor-it is a professional fund\nmanagement team that takes care of thefunds invested. The performance of these\ninvestments impacts the returns generated by the mutual fund scheme. The deciding\nfactors are: the movement of the specific market in whichthe money is invested, the\nperformance of individual securities held and the skills of the investment management\nteam. Out of these, the fund manager can work towards improvingone's skills, but the\nother factors are out of his control.\n\n\n## 2.2 Classification of Mutual Funds\n\n\n## Mutual funds can be classified in multiple ways. Funds can be classified based on the\ninvestment objective, as discussed earlier. We have different types of mutual fund\nschemes--growth funds, income funds, and liquid funds. The names of the categories\nsuggest the investment objectives of the schemes. The other ways in which the mutual\nfunds can be classified have been discussed below.\n\n\n## 2.2.1 By the structure of the fund\n\n\n## Mutual fund schemes are structured differently. Some schemes are open for purchase\nand repurchase on a perpetual basis. Once the scheme is launched, the scheme\nremains open for transactions, and hence the name of this category of schemes is\nopen-ended funds. On the other hand, some schemes have a fixed maturity date. This\nmeans that these schemes are structured to operate for a fixed period till the maturity\ndate and cease to exist thereafter. Since the closure of the scheme is pre-decided, such\nschemes are known as close-ended schemes. Apart from these two, there are a couple\nof other variants, which would be discussed later.\n\n\n## 34\n\n\n## 24",

Prospective investors can also buy units. At any time, the existing\ninvestors can redeem their investments, that is, they can sell the units back to the\nscheme to get their money back.\n\n\n## Although some unit-holders may exit from the scheme, wholly or partly, the scheme\ncontinues operations with the remaining investors. The scheme does not have any kind\nof time frame in which it is to be closed. The ongoing entry and exit of investors imply\nthat the unit capital in an open-ended fund would keep changing on a regular basis.\n\n\n## When an investor invests money in the scheme, new units would be created and thus\nthe unit balance would increase. On the other hand, when someone exits the scheme\n(fully or partly), the units sold back to the scheme would be cancelled, due to which the\nunit balance of the scheme would go down.\n\n\n## Close-ended funds have a fixed maturity. Investors can buy units of a close-ended\nscheme, from the fund, only during its NFO. The investors cannot transact with the fund\nafter the NFO is over. At the end of the maturity period, the scheme is wound up, units\nare cancelled and the money is returned to the investors. The fund makes\narrangements for providing liquidity,post-NFO through listing of the units on a stock\nexchange. Such listing is compulsory for close-ended schemes to provide liquidity to the\ninvestors. Therefore, after the NFO, investors who want to buy units will have to find\na seller for those units in the stock exchange. Similarly, investors who want to sell units\nwill have to find a buyer for those units in the stock exchange. Since post-NFO sale and\npurchase of units happen to or from counter-party in the stock exchange-and not to\nor from the scheme–the unit capital of the scheme remains stable or fixed. Every close\nended scheme, other than an equity linked savings scheme, shall be listed on a\nrecognised stock exchange within such time period and subject to such conditions as\nspecified by SEBI.\n\n\n## Post-NFO, the sale and purchase transactions happen on the stock exchange between\ntwo different investors, and the fund is not involved in the transaction. Depending on\nthe demand-supply situation for the units of the scheme on the stock exchange, the\ntransaction price could be higher or lower than the prevailing NAV. Therefore, the\ntransaction price is likely to be different from the NAV. Experience suggests that most\nof the time, the units trade at a discount to the NAV. This can be understood logically.\nThe buyer has money, and hence many options to choose from, whereas the seller has\nthe units of the close-ended fund. This puts the buyer in a better bargaining position.\n\n5 NFO stands for New Fund Offer, or the launch of a mutual fund scheme. This is when the scheme is offered to public\nfor the first time.\n\n\n## 35",

They\nare largely close-ended but become open-ended at pre-specified intervals. For\ninstance, an interval scheme might become open-ended between January 1 to 15, and\nJuly 1 to 15, each year. The benefit for investors is that, unlike in a purely close-ended\nscheme, they are not completely dependent on the stock exchange to be able to buy\nor sell units of the interval fund. However, to provide liquidity to the investors between\nthese intervals, the units must be compulsorily listed on stock exchanges to allow\ninvestors an exit route.\n\n\n## The periods when an interval scheme becomes open-ended, are called 'transaction\nperiods';the period between the close of a transaction period, and the opening of the\nnext transaction period is called the 'interval period'.

These funds usually track an index or have a fixed portfolio\nstrategy based on some index so they are passive in nature. In effect they are like a normal\nmutual fund but the only difference being that while an open-ended fund would have a single\nNAV at the end of the day at which all the transactions take place the situation is different for\nthe ETF. Since the ETF is traded for the entire day, it gives multiple opportunities and prices\nat which the investor can either enter or exit the fund. This is similar to any other listed\nsecurities where there are multiple prices at which transactions take place and this is\nwitnessed for an ETF too. ETFs provide additional liquidity for investors and enable them to\ntake benefit of changes that take place in prices during the day. The downside to this is that\nthe prices might fluctuate quite a bit and there might be a big gap with the NAV of the fund\ntoo. So, investors need to be careful about the price at which they are undertaking their\ntransactions. There is ease of investing in an ETF because one can buy them just like a stock\nand the minimum investment here is also so small that any investor can participate by having\nthese in their portfolio. Investors who already transact on the stock exchanges and have\ndemat account can use these for investing in ETFs. There is a huge variety in terms of the\nindices on which ETFs are based and hence this provides investors with a lot of choice in terms\nof their investments and the kind of exposure that they can take. Increasingly mutual funds\nare also coming out with different variants that employ varying strategies for their ETF\nofferings. Like Gold ETF recently Silver ETF has also been introduced by SEBI that can be\ndefined as a mutual fund scheme that invests primarily in silver or silver related instruments\nwhich are specified by SEBI from time to time.\n\n\n## 2.2.2 By the management of the portfolio\n\n\n## Actively managed funds are funds where the fund manager has the flexibility to\nchoose the investment portfolio, within the broad parameters of the investment\nobjective of the scheme.Since this increases the role of the fund manager, the expenses\nfor running the fund turn out to be higher. Investors expect actively managed funds to\nperform better than the market.\n\n\n## Passive funds invest on the basis of a specified index; whose performance it seeks to\ntrack. Thus, a passive fund tracking the S&P BSE Sensex would buy only the shares that\nare part of the composition of the S&P BSE Sensex. The proportion of each share in the\nscheme's portfolio would also be the same as the weightage assigned to the share in\nthe S&P BSE Sensex. Thus, the performance of these funds tends to mirror the\nconcerned index. They are not designed to perform better than the market. Such\nschemes are also called index schemes.Since the portfolio is determined by the index\nitself, the fund manager has no role in deciding on investments. Therefore, these\nschemes have low running costs.\n\n\n## 37",

AMCs tend to\nstructurethe scheme around pre-identified investments. Further, being close-ended\nschemes, they do not accept money post-NFO. Therefore, the fund manager has a little\nongoing role in deciding on the investment options. Such a portfolio construction gives\nmore clarity to investors on the likely returns if they stay invested in the scheme until\nits maturity (though there can be no guarantee or assurance of such returns). This\nhelps them compare the risk and returns ofthe scheme with alternative investments.\n\n\n# Target Maturity Date Funds (TMF) are a type of debt mutual fund in India that offer a\nunique investment strategy. These funds are designed to mature on a specific date,\ntypically ranging from 2 to 10 years, allowing investors to plan their financial goals\naccordingly. TMFs invest in bonds with matching maturities, minimizing reinvestment\nrisk and providing predictable returns. They are ideal for investors seeking low-risk,\nincome-generating investments with a defined horizon, such as retirement planning or\n\n\n## children's education.\n\n\n## Infrastructure Debt Funds are investment vehicles that can be sponsored by\ncommercial banks and NBFCs in India in which domestic/offshore institutional\ninvestors, especially insurance and pension funds can invest through units and bonds\nissued by the IDFs. Infrastructure Debt Funds (IDFs), can be set up either as a Trust or\nas a Company. A trust based IDF would normally be a Mutual Fund (MF), regulated by\nSEBI, while a company based IDF would normally be an NBFC regulated by the Reserve\nBank.\n\n\n## 44",

The structure, which has inherent checks and balances to protect the\ninterests of the investors, can be briefly described as follows:\n\n- Mutual funds are constituted as Trusts. Therefore, they are governed by the\nIndian Trusts Act, 1882\n- The mutual fund trust is created by one or more Sponsors, who are the main\npersons behind the mutual fund business.\n- Every trust has beneficiaries. The beneficiaries, in the case of a mutual fund trust,\nare the investors who invest in various schemes of the mutual fund, called unit-holders.\nThe operations of the mutual fund trust are governed by a Trust Deed, which is\nexecuted between the sponsors and the trustees. SEBI has laid down various clauses\nthat need to be part of the Trust Deed.\n- The Trust acts through its trustees. Therefore, the role of protecting the interests of\nthe beneficiaries (investors/ unit-holders) is that of the Trustees. The first trustees are\nnamed in the Trust Deed, which also prescribes the procedure for a change in Trustees.\n- To perform the trusteeship role, either individuals may be appointed as trustees or\na Trustee company may be appointed. When individuals are appointed as trustees, they\n\n\n## 48",

A trustee company functions through its\nBoard of Directors.\n\n- Day to day management of the schemes is handled by an Asset Management\nCompany (AMC). The AMC is appointed by the sponsor or the Trustees.\n- The trustees execute an investment management agreement with the AMC, setting\nout its responsibilities.\n- Although the AMC manages the schemes, custody of the assets of the scheme\n(securities, gold, gold-related instruments & real estate assets & silver or silver related\ninstruments) is with a Custodian, who is appointed by the Trustees.\n- Investors invest in various schemes of the mutual fund. The record of investors and\ntheir unit-holding may be maintained by the AMC itself, or it can appoint a Registrar &\nTransfer Agent (RTA).\n\n\n## 3.2 Key Constituents of a Mutual Fund\n\n\n## 3.2.1 Sponsors\n\n\n## The application to SEBI for registration of a mutual fund is made by the sponsor(s).\nThereafter, the sponsor invests in the capital of the AMC.\n\n\n## Since sponsors are the main people behind the mutual fund operation. The sponsor\nshould have a sound track record and reputation of fairness and integrity in all business\ntransactions. The sponsor should be carrying on business in financial services for not\nless than 5years. The sponsor should ensure a positive net worth (share capital plus\nreserves minus accumulated losses) in all the immediately preceding 5 years. The\nsponsor should be a fit and proper person for this kind of operation.\n\n\n## Association of Mutual Funds in India's (AMFI) website¹4 lists the names of all the Asset\nManagement Companies, which are members of AMFI, in terms of the category of the\nsponsor, viz., Banks, Institutions, Private sector, etc. Within banks, there are\npredominantly Indian joint ventures, and others; and similarly, within the private\nsector, there are Indian, foreign, and predominantly Indian joint ventures.\n\n\n## 14 www.amfiindia.com\n\n\n## 49",

Their offices in\nvarious centers serve as Investor Service Centers (ISCs), which perform a useful role in\nhandling the documentation of investors. The functions of the RTA include processing\nof purchase and redemption transactions of the investor and dealing with the financial\ntransactions of receiving funds for purchases and making payments for redemptions,\nupdating the unit capital of the scheme to reflect these transactions, updating the\ninformation in the individualrecords of the investor, called folios, keeping the investor\nupdated about the status of their investment account and information related to the\ninvestment.\n\n\n## The appointment of RTA is done by the AMC.

A copy of this letter can be submitted to any SEBI\nregistered intermediary with whom the investor wants to transact.

According to these guidelines, there have to be\nat least two valuation agencies that provide valuation matrix. The AMCs have to make\nuse of this matrix to arrive at fair valuation of these investments. AMFI has appointed\nCRISIL Ltd. and ICRA Ltd.for the purpose.\n\n\n# 3.4.8 Credit Rating Agencies\n\n\n## Credit rating agencies rate debt securities issued by various issuers. Fund managers\nconsider such ratings as an initial input while taking investment decisions, prior to\ndoing their own due diligence. In few mutual fund products, credit rating assumes\ngreater importance. Certain categories of debt funds such as corporate bond funds,\ncredit risk funds are defined on the basis of credit rating. Even capital protection-\noriented schemes need to carry a credit rating assigned by the rating agency. Such\nschemes have restrictions pertaining to their investment universe, which is also a\nfunction of the creditrating assigned by these agencies.\n\n\n## In case of Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs), the AMC is allowed to disclose the proposed\nrating profile of the scheme before the portfolio is constructed. It is then mandatory\nto invest in debt securities only within the proposed rating profile, or less risky papers\n(higher credit rating than proposed). Thus, credit rating agencies assume an important\nrole in case of debt mutual funds.\n\n\n## 3.4.9 Depositories and the Depository Participants\n\n\n# A depository is an institution, which holds the securities in dematerialised or electronic\nform on behalf of the investors.

The units of ETFs are\ncompulsorily held in demat form as only demat securities care allowed to be traded on\nstock exchanges.\n\n\n## The depositories reach out to the investors through the depository participants.

The units\nof close-ended funds and ETFs are compulsorily listed on at least one stock exchange.\nAt the same time, units of open-ended funds are also available through special\nsegments on the stock exchanges. At the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), this segment\nis known as BSE-Star MF;while at the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE), it is called\nNSE Mutual Fund II Platform (NMF-II). Now, investors can also transact directly through\nstock exchanges.\n\n\n## MF Utilities India is another transaction platform for units of mutual funds. This is an\ninitiative by the mutual fund industry under the Association of Mutual Funds in India\n(AMFI). This platform allows for the aggregation of transactions for a mutual fund\ninvestor. Investors can perform various transactions such as purchase, sale, switch, etc.\nInvestors are able to complete their required transactions across multiple mutual\nfunds using a single platform which makes it easier for them to handle.\n\n\n## These platforms play a very important role in enhancing the reach of mutual funds.\nFurther, the internet and mobile based applications have helped to reduce paperwork\nand reduce transaction related errors. These applications make the process simple to\nexecute and this increases the comfort level of investors to transact.\n\n\n## 3.5 Role and Function of AMFI\n\n- Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) is the association of all the registered\nAsset Management Companies. The objectives of AMFI are: To define and maintain\nhigh professional and ethical standards in all areas of operation of the mutual fund\n\n\n## 60\n\n\n<!-- Page 61 -->\n\n\n## industry.\n\n- To recommend and promote best business practices and code of conduct to be\nfollowed by members and others engaged in the activities of mutual fund and asset\nmanagement including agencies connected or involved in the field of capital markets\nand financial services.\n- To interact with SEBI and to represent to SEBI on all matters concerning the mutual\nfund industry.\n- To represent to the Government, Reserve Bank of India and other bodies on\nallmatters relating to the mutual fund Industry.\n- To undertake a nationwide investor awareness programme to promote proper\nunderstanding of the concept and working of mutual funds.\n- To disseminate information on the mutual fund industry and to undertake studies\nandresearch directly and/or in association with other bodies.\n- To regulate the conduct of distributors including disciplinary actions (cancellation\nofARN) for violations of Code of Conduct.\n- To protect the interest of investors/unitholders.\n\n\n## A major role of AMFI involves the registration of mutual fund distributors, by allotting\nthem AMFI Registration Number (ARN), which is mandatory for becoming a mutual fund\ndistributor. Periodically, AMFI also issues various circulars recommending best\npractices for the asset management companies, as well as the distributors.\n\n\n## An important point to note here is that AMFI is neither a regulatory body nor a Self-\nRegulatoryOrganisation (SRO).\n\n\n## Cyber Security and Cyber Resilience\n\n\n## With a key objective to address evolving cyber threats, to align with the industry\nstandards, to encourage efficient audits, and to ensure compliance by SEBI Registered\nEntities (RES), SEBI has issued detailed Cyber Security and Cyber Resilience Framework\n(CSCRF). The CSCRF also sets out standards formats for reporting by REs.\n\n\n# The CSCRF is standards based and broadly covers the five cyber resiliency goals adopted\nfrom Cyber Crisis Management Plan (CCMP) of Indian Computer Emergency Response\nTeam (CERT-In) for countering Cyber Attacks and Cyber Terrorism including:\n\n- Anticipate\n- Withstand\n- Contain\n- Recover\n- Evolve\n\n\n## 61",

As mentioned above, while money market funds can invest in\nmoney market securities that mature in less than a year; liquid funds can invest in debt\nand money market securities maturing within 91 days. This means the interest rate\nrisk20 is very low in both these funds. Money market securities also have high credit\nrating, and hence the credit risk2¹ is very low.\n\nThese funds are considered to be among the lowest risk funds within mutual funds.\n\n\n## Low interest rate risk coupled with low credit risk makes these funds suitable for short\nterm parking of surplus money. Many mutual fund distributors recommend these\nfunds to their investors when the surplus is available for short, but uncertain periods.\n\n\n## Many also use these funds for another purpose. They park the customer's surplus\nfunds in liquid or money market funds, and then periodically transfer the same in\nequity funds on a regular basis – a process known as Systematic Transfer Plan (STP).\n\n\n# 4.3 Index Funds\n\n\n## An Index Fund is an open-ended scheme replicating/tracking a specific index. The\nminimum investment in securities of a particular index (which is being replicated/\ntracked) shall be 95 percent of total assets. In other words, at least 95 percent of the\nassets of the scheme must be invested in the constituents of the index.\n\n\n# In order to understand an index fund, it is important to know what an index is. A stock\nmarket index is created by selecting a group of stocks that are representative of the\nwhole market or a specified sector or segment of the market. An Index is calculated\nwith reference to a base period and a base index value. An Index is used to give\n\n20 Interest rate risk is the sensitivity of debt securities with respect to movement of interest rates within the economy.\nWhen the interest rates move up, prices of debt papers move down, and vice versa.\n\n21 Refer to Chapter 7 for further details on this risk.\n\n\n## 64",

It is also known as the barometer of the respective\nmarket. When the value of the index moves up, the market is considered have moved\nup, and vice versa. Looking at it in another way, observers look at the index movement\nto check whether the market is up or down.\n\n\n# There are indices to track various markets, across asset categories. Here is a list of\nsome of the indices available in the various markets:\n\n\n## S&P BSE Sensex is an index representing stocks of 30 large companies listed on\nthe BSE Ltd\n\n\n## NIFTY 50 is an index that represents stocks of 50 large companies listed on the\nNational Stock Exchange.\n\n- NIFTY SmallCap 250 is an index that represents stocks of 250 small companies\nlisted on the National Stock Exchange.\n- CRISIL Liquid Fund Index is an index that seeks to track the performance of\nliquid funds - essentially representing liquid funds.\n- I-Sec Li-Bex is an index representing Government bonds with long term\nmaturity (of more than 7 years).\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Russell 3000 index is an index representing 3000 stocks listed in the US stock\nmarkets\n\n- Nifty Bank Index is an index that comprises of the most liquid and large Indian\nbanks.\n\n\n## An index fund is a mutual fund that replicates an index. Thus, an index fund becomes\nthe simplest product for an investor seeking to take an exposure to a market or a\nsegment thereof. Someone who wants to invest in large companies in India can simply\nbuy an index fund tracking S&P BSE Sensex or Nifty. Similarly, one can take exposure\nto the small cap segment of the market by buying Nifty SmallCap 250 index fund\n(assuming that such a fund is available). As we can also see from the above examples,\nthere are indices available on sectors, and hence there could be funds available that\ntrack such indices. There could also be mutual funds investing in foreign stocks, or even\ndebt papers and government securities.\n\n\n## 22 Source: www.nseindia.com\n\n\n## 65\n\n\n## 65",

In other words, the fund manager does not need to decide\nwhich securities to buy or sell and when to do so.\n\n\n## Due to a very limited role of the fund management team, the total expense ratio\n(TER)23 in case of index funds is very low. SEBI has also allowed a lower limit of the\nmaximum expenses that could be charged.\n\n\n# Given such characteristics of the index funds, they make a good choice for many\ninvestors:\n\n- As already mentioned, it is the simplest way to take exposure to any market.\n\n\n## ·\n\n\n## ·\n\n\n## For those seeking wealth creation, but are not sure which schemes to choose,\nequity-oriented index funds could be an ideal choice.\n\n\n## For those seeking to invest overseas, but do not possess enough skills to\nconduct research on foreign stocks, an index fund tracking the respective\nforeign market is an excellent choice.\n\n\n## Since the index fund tracks the underlying index, it becomes easy for an investor to\nunderstand and track the performance of the scheme.

In other words,\none's wealth increases when the investment yields higher returns than inflation. At the\nsame time, equity is a risky asset in that the share prices fluctuate a lot. Due to such\nfluctuations, there is a high possibility that one may end up buying at high prices or\nselling at low prices or both.\n\n\n## There is also a risk involved in equity investing. When an investor invests in a\ncompany's share, there is a possibility that the company does very well, and the share\nprice moves up over the years. At the same time, if the company struggles or incurs\nlosses or fails altogether, the shareholder loses. The loss could be as much as the entire\ncapital invested. While investors would want to invest in such an asset category, but\nwould also like to reduce the risk as much as possible.\n\n23 See Section 2.2.3 for the discussion on Total Expense Ratio\n\n\n## 66",

For a\nlarge number of investors, SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) helps here.\n\n\n## A diversified equity fund is a simple type of mutual fund that invests across a wide\nspectrum of companies representing a number of industrial sector. Such diversification\nreduces the risk of owning one company's share or the risk of owning shares of\ncompanies from one industry.\n\n\n## Care must be taken by the distributor to see the segment of the market that such a\nfund is investing in is it investing in stocks of large companies, or mid-sized\ncompanies, or small companies, or a combination of these? The large companies are\ngenerally less risky in comparison to their smaller counterparts. At the same time,\nthese small companies also offer higher return potential. Care must be taken to\nunderstand this while selecting the schemes for the investors.\n\n\n# 4.5 Retirement Benefit Schemes\n\n\n## Retirement Fund: An open-ended retirement solution-oriented scheme having a lock-\nin of 5 years or till retirement age (whichever is earlier). Scheme having a lock-in for at\nleast 5 years or till retirement age whichever is earlier. The retirement benefit schemes\nare meant for creating a retirement corpus that can generate income to fund the\nlifestyle after one retires from work.\n\n\n## Most fund houses offer more than one options under this category to satisfy the needs\nof different categories of investors, depending on their risk-taking ability. For those\nwho can afford to take high risks, there are plans that allocate more money to equity\nassets, whereas for the conservative investors, the fund houses offer plans with higher\nallocation to debt (which means lower allocation to equity).\n\n\n## These schemes come with a lock-in of 5 years, and offer tax benefit under Section 80C\nof the Income Tax Act.\n\n\n## Depending on the type of scheme, the investment would be predominantly between\nequity and debt securities.

AMCs tend to\nstructure the scheme around pre-identified investments. Further, being close-ended\nschemes, they do not accept money post-NFO. Therefore, the fund manager has little\nongoing role in deciding on the investment options. Such a portfolio construction gives\nmore clarity to investors on the likely returns if they stay invested in the scheme until\nits maturity (though there can be no guarantee or assurance of such returns). This\nhelps them compare the risk and returns of the scheme with alternative investments.\n\n\n## As already mentioned, the big benefit of such schemes is that it is relatively easy to\nestimate the returns expected from such schemes. At the same time, these are close-\nended funds and hence no redemption is allowed before the scheme's maturity. On\nmaturity of the scheme, the investors' money is returned. In order to provide liquidity\nto the investors, listing of the units of such schemes on recognized stock exchanges is\ncompulsory. However, such listing does not guarantee liquidity, as the trading volumes\nin these units may be very low, or there may be no trading at all.\n\n\n## The Asset Management Companies (AMCs) are required to publish a list of such simple\nand performing schemes on their websites to enable to new cadre of distributors to\ndistribute these schemes to their clients.\n\n\n## Drivers of returns\n\n\n## In the liquid and money market funds, the major driver of the scheme returns would\nbe the yield earned from the debt instruments. Similarly, in case of FMPs too, the\nreturns would come from the yield on the debt securities.\n\n\n## The diversified equity funds and the index funds would derive the returns from the\nreturns generated by the portfolio of stocks the scheme has invested in.\n\n\n## The returns from the retirement funds would depend on how the money is allocated\nbetween equity and debt.\n\n\n## 68",

So, what are the scheme related documents?\n\n\n## The legal documents that provide the information that the investor requires are\navailable in the scheme related documents (Scheme Information Document,\nStatement of Additional Information) and the Key Information Memorandum.\n\n\n## Scheme related documents can be used for making an informed investment decision.\nThe suitability of a mutual fund scheme to an investor depends upon the features of\nthe scheme and matching it to the needs of the investor from the investment.\n\n\n## Investors need to note that their investments are governed by the principle of caveat\nemptor i.e., let the buyer beware. An investor is presumed to have read and\nunderstood the scheme related documents before investing in a mutual fund scheme.\nIn fact, since this is a contractual arrangement, the person signing the application form\nhas legally accepted the terms of the offer. Therefore, an investor cannot claim at a\nfuture date of being unaware of a fact that was disclosed in the scheme related\ndocuments.\n\n\n# There are primarily two important documents for understanding about the mutual\nfund scheme:\n\n- Scheme Information Document (SID), which has details of the particular scheme24\nb) Statement of Additional Information (SAI), which has statutory information about\nthemutual fund or AMC, that is offering the scheme.\n\n24 https://www.sebi.gov.in/legal/circulars/nov-2023/simplification-and-streamlining-of-offer-documents-of-\n\n\n## mutual-fund-schemes 78665.html\n\n\n## 70\n\n\n## 70\n\n\n<!-- Page 71 -->\n\n\n# It stands to reason that a single SAI is relevant for all the schemes offered by a mutual\nfund. In practice, SID and SAI are two separate documents, though the legal technicality\nis that SAI is part of the SID.\n\n\n# Both documents are prepared in the format prescribed by SEBI and submitted to SEBI.\nThe contents need to flow in the same sequence as in the prescribed format. The\nmutual fund is permitted to add any other disclosure, which it feels, is 'material' for the\ninvestor.\n\n\n## Since investors are not sophisticated experts of finance or law, the documents are\nprepared in simple language, and in a clear, concise and easy to understand style.\n\n\n# While SEBI does not approve or disapprove the Scheme Related Documents, it gives its\nobservations. The mutual fund needs to incorporate these observations in these\ndocuments. Thus, the Documents in the market are \"vetted\" by SEBI, and not approved\nby SEBI.25\n\n\n## Draft SID and SAI are public documents, available for viewing on SEBI's website\n(www.sebi.gov.in). The final documents (after incorporating SEBI's observations) have\nto be hosted on AMFI's website (www.amfiindia.com) two days before the issue opens.\nEvery mutual fund, on its website, provides for download of these documents for all its\ncurrent schemes.\n\n\n## Objective of the scheme related documents\n\n\n## SID and SAI together are the primary source of information for any investor-existing\nas well as prospective. These are the operating documents that describe the product.\n\n\n## Since the investor is required to make an informed investment decision, these\ndocuments serve the purpose of providing the required information in an easy-to-\nunderstand language.\n\n\n## The units of the scheme are offered to the investor through the scheme related\ndocuments. By signing the application form and making a payment, the investor is\naccepting the offer, and by issuing units against such an acceptance, the mutual fund\nthen completes the contract. Thus, the scheme related documents contain information\nthat forms the basis of the contractual relationship between the investor and the fund.\n\n\n# 5.1.1 Scheme Information Document\n\nThe Scheme Information Document (SID) sets forth the information about the scheme\n\n\n## 25 Candidates are advised to read the circular: https://www.sebi.gov.in/legal/circulars/dec-2024/upload-of-draft-\nscheme-information-documents_90097.html\n\n\n## 71",

SEBI has\nmandated that the Asset Management Companies (AMCs) should prominently disclose\non a daily basis, the Total expense ratio (scheme-wise, date-wise) of all schemes under\na separate head – \"Total Expense Ratio of Mutual Fund Schemes\" on their website.

This process of building a portfolio could be achieved with the\nhelp of the selection of a basket of mutual fund schemes. However, one may still need\nhelp in constructing a portfolio with the help of an expert.

This analysis would help the mutual fund\ndistributor arrive at a suitable asset allocation plan for the investor. Armed with this,\nthe distributor then goes on to identify mutual fund schemes, which are appropriate\nfor the investor in the given situation.\n\n\n## Look at this in another way, the mutual fund distributor analyses the situation of the\ninvestor; whereas the fund manager analyses the market factors. Both the professionals\nplay importantroles in helping the investor achieve one's financial goals.\n\nWith that background look at various categories of mutual fund distributors.\n\n\n## 6.2 Different kinds of mutual fund distributors\n\n\n## Mutual funds are distributed in India to the investors through multiple channels, viz.,\nindividual mutual fund distributors, bank branches, national distributors through their\nbranches or their sub-agents, post offices, and directly by the AMCs. While the category\nof distributors is also varied, the platforms used are also many. Funds may be\ndistributed through the traditional method of using paper-based application forms, or\nthrough electronic platforms such as websites, mobile phones and stock exchanges.\n\nLet us first look at the different categories and their characteristics.\n\n\n## 6.2.1 Individual players\n\n\n## India has a long history of distribution of financial products through individuals. Both\nLife Insurance Corporation of India Ltd (LIC), and Unit Trust of India (UTI) depended on\na huge force of individual agents. While the two institutions made various products and\nsolutions available, the agency force (i.e., individual agents) ensured these products\nreached the households. These same agents also distributed the small savings\nproducts, and to that extent, they played a huge role in bringing household savings into\nfinancial products.\n\n\n## Almost all of them operated as individuals, and single-handedly, without any staff or\nskeletonstaff, mainly to handle the paperwork. Even today, this is a very large part of\nthe distribution link between the asset management companies and the investors.\nQuite a few new mutual fund distributors start their business this way single-\nhandedly, as individuals.\n\nLater, some of them expand and grow into larger entities. While the former is known\n\n\n## 82",

  {
    "page_content": "<!-- Page 83 -->\n\nas the \"individual\" channel, the rest can be called the \"non-individual\" channel.\n\n\n# The traditional non-institutional channels operate through different business models.\nThese could be as under:\n\n- Through their own branch offices and employees\n- Through a network of sub-agents\n\n\n## 6.2.2 Non-individual entities\n\n\n## Non-individual entities include partnerships, regional distributors, national\ndistributors, NBFCs, banks, stockbrokers, etc. Out of these, the distribution companies\nand banks are sometimes referred as institutional distributors.\n\n\n## In both cases, the investor is serviced by an individual—be it an employee of the firm or\na sub-agent. However, the difference lies in the operations of the firm and its cost\nstructure—the former incurs fixed expenses of running the large operations, whereas\nthe latter have highervariable costs. The employees earn through salary, whereas the\nsub-agents earn a commission, which is linked to the business generated.\n\n\n## Within the non-individual distributors, there are different business models.\n\n\n## Banks\n\n\n## Banks have emerged as a prominent channel for the distribution of mutual fund\nproducts to their account holders. Within the banking structure, the multinational\nbanks were the first to enter the business of mutual fund distribution. The private\nsector banks and the public-sectorbanks entered the business much later. Nowadays,\neven some cooperative banks are also distributing mutual funds. Banks employ\ndifferent business units catering to different client segments, viz., retail banking and\nwealth management or priority banking or private banking.The categorization is based\non the wealth of the clients or the surplus available for investment in financial assets.\n\n\n## Mutual funds have built relationships with PSU banks that have a wide reach in non-\nurban centres to distribute mutual fund products through them. Also, private and\nforeign banks actively participate in the distribution process of mutual fund products.\n\n\n# Many others like stock brokers and NBFC also use a similar classification between retail\nclientsand wealthy clients. While some NBFCs and stock brokers reach out to service\ntheir clients through their own employees, some have empaneled sub-agents. One may\n\n\n## 83",

These sub-agents are not employees of the firm but\npurely work as an extended distribution arm.\n\n\n# While the banks and NBFCs may operate at a national level, there could be some other\nfirms that only distribute financial products. Some of these firms may have a national\npresence, whilesome others may operate within a region. These are often referred as\nnational distributor or regional distributors in the mutual fund industry.\n\n\n## Some new players have entered the fray of late. These are the e-commerce platforms\nand few other online distributors that also distribute mutual fund schemes. These\nplayers operatethrough the internet without having a physical office for the clients to\nvisit. SEBI Circular dated 13 June 2023 provides the guidelines for Execution Only\nPlatforms, relevant for digital / online platforms.\n\n\n## 6.3 Modes of distribution\n\n\n## Traditionally, not just mutual funds, but all financial products were distributed through\nthe use of application forms printed on paper. This process involved carrying physical\nforms to the client's place and then depositing those forms at the respective official\npoints of acceptance (OPOAs). With the advent of the internet and mobile phones, the\ndistribution channel shifted to digital mode. Of late, the balance is shifting towards\ndigital transactions, though the physical paper-based transactions continue in a\nsignificant way.\n\n\n## Many distributors and their investors still prefer the paper mode, whereas the new age\nInternet-based businesses, viz. e-commerce platforms, and online distributors operate\nentirely through the digital mode.\n\n\n## On the other hand, there are a few that employ a hybrid mode, where some transactions\ntake place digitally, some others happen physically.\n\n\n## The different models of online distribution are discussed below.\n\n\n# 6.3.1 Online Channel Partners\n\n\n## The advent of the internet has changed the way business is conducted in many\nindustries, and mutual fund distribution is no different.

Exchanges have developed mutual fund transaction engines for\nthis purpose. The low cost and deeper reach of the stock exchange network enable an\nincreased level of participation of retail investors in mutual funds. AMCs are required\nto list the units of close- ended and interval schemes on a stock exchange and the units\nof ETFs are also bought and sold in the stock exchange.\n\n\n## Both National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) have extended\ntheir trading platforms to help the stock exchange brokers become a channel for\ninvestors to transact in Mutual Fund units. NSE's platform is called NMF II Platform.\nBSE's platform is the BSE STAR Mutual Funds Platform.\n\n\n## 6.3.3 Aggregating platforms\n\n\n## MF Utilities (MFU) is a transaction aggregating platform that connects investors, RTAs,\ndistributors, banks, AMCs and others. MFU facilitates the distributors with online\naccess to submit investor transactions. This platform provides them with a single point\nfor time- stamping of transactions, document submission, paperless transaction\nfacility, and login facility for their clients.\n\n\n## Investors who register on the MFU are allotted a Common Account Number (CAN)\nunder which all their mutual fund holdings are consolidated. Investors have to be KYC\ncompliant to register for a CAN. If an investor is not already KYC compliant, then the MFU\nwill facilitate KYCregistration along with the allotment of 'CAN'.\n\n\n## The MFU offers a Common Transaction Form to transact in multiple schemes across\nparticipating mutual funds using a single form. The form can be submitted through a\nmutual fund distributor or to neutral Points of Service (POS) and others irrespective of\nthe RTA servicing the mutual fund. MFU offers multiple modes of payments for\ninvestment through physical and electronic means. MFU allows a single payment for\nmultiple subscriptions made under a single form. The existing mutual fund holding is\nmapped to the CAN based on PAN, holding pattern and other parameters. Investors\nmay have multiple CANs based on the combination of holdings and mode of holding.\nInvestors can also request online access through which they can submit transactions,\nview holdings and lodge and track complaints. The bank and nomination details\nprovided to the MFU at the time of registering for the CAN will override the information\nprovided in the folios.\n\n\n## Now another similar platform called MF Central has been launched, promoted by\nKFintech and CAMS.\n\n\n## 85\n\n\n## 55",

We will cover the details of additional\nexpenses later in Chapter 7.\n\n\n# 6.5.3 Transaction Charges\n\n\n## To cater to people with small saving potential and to increase reach of mutual fund\nproductsin urban areas and smaller towns, SEBI has allowed a transaction charge per\nsubscription of Rs. 10,000/- and above to be paid to distributors of the mutual fund\nproducts. However, thereshall be no transaction charges on direct investments. The\ntransaction charge, if any, is deducted by the AMC from the subscription amount and\npaid to the distributor; and the balance amount is invested.\n\n\n## Type of Investor\n\n\n# Transaction Charges (Rs.)\n(For\n\n\n## purchase/subscription of\n\n\n## Rs. 10,000 and above)\n\n\n## First time mutual fund investor\n\n\n## Rs. 150/-\n\n\n# Investor other than first time mutual\nfund investor\n\n\n## Rs. 100/-\n\n\n## The transaction charge is deducted from the gross investments of the investor and paid\nto the distributor and the balance shall be invested. The statement of accounts (SOA)\nshows thenet investment made as the gross subscription less transaction charge and\nprovides the number of units allotted against the net subscription.\n\n\n## For example, for an investment of Rs. 25,000 at NAV of Rs. 43.21 came from a first-time\nmutual fund investor. Then the transaction charge would be deductible at Rs. 150. In\nthis case, the number of units allotted would be (Rs. 25,000 – Rs. 150) ÷ Rs. 43.21 i.e.,\n575.098.\n\n\n# In case of investments through SIP, transaction charges are deducted only if the total\ncommitment (i.e., amount per SIP instalment x number of instalments) amounts to Rs.\n10,000or more. The Transaction Charge is deducted in four equal instalments.\nHowever, transaction Charges will not be deducted for the following:\n\n- Purchase/Subscription submitted by the investor at the designated collection centres\nor through AMC's website and which are not routed through any distributor.\n\n\n## 95",

The same has been discussed in earlier.\n\n\n# 7.3 Concept of risk in a mutual fund investment\n\n\n## Investing in mutual fund units carries risks such as trading volumes, settlement issues,\nliquidity risk, and default risk, including the potential loss of principal. The value of\ninvestments in the scheme may rise or fall due to fluctuations in the price, value, or\ninterest rates of the underlying securities. The scheme's NAV can be affected by\nbroader market movements, influenced by factors like interest rates, currency\nchanges, government policies, taxation, and political or economic developments.\n\n\n## Past performance of the Sponsor, AMC, or Mutual Fund does not guarantee future\nresults. The scheme's name does not reflect its quality or future returns.\n\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\n\n## A scheme's liquidity can be affected by factors like trading volumes, settlement\nperiods, and transfer procedures. While generally invested in liquid securities, liquidity\nmay be impacted by market, sector, or company-specific events. Portfolio rebalancing\nand redemptions can lead to price fluctuations.\n\n\n## Settlement delays in Indian financial markets may leave assets temporarily un-\ninvested, causing missed investment opportunities. Illiquid markets, especially in the\nsecondary debt and money markets, can prevent timely selling of securities, potentially\nleading to losses if market conditions deteriorate.\n\n\n## Although government securities are more liquid, extreme market volatility or RBI\nregulatory changes may still challenge liquidity.\n\n\n# Interest Rate Risk\n\n\n## Fixed income securities such as government bonds, corporate bonds, money market\ninstruments and derivatives run price-risk or interest-rate risk. Generally, when interest\nrates rise, prices of existing fixed income securities fall and when interest rates drop,\nsuch prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices depends upon the coupon\nand maturity of the security. It also depends upon the yield level at which the security\nis being traded.\n\nDerivatives carry the risk of adverse changes in the price due to change in interest rates.\n\n\n## 109",

This risk refers\nto the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the securities in the\nScheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the 'interest on\ninterest' component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be\nreinvested may be lower than that originally assumed.\n\n\n## Political Risk\n\n\n## Investments in mutual fund Units in India may be materially adversely impacted by\nIndian politics and changes in the political scenario in India either at the central, state\nor local level. Actions of the central government or respective state governments in the\nfuture could have a significant effect on the Indian economy, which could affect\ncompanies, general business and market conditions, prices and yields of securities in\nwhich the Scheme invest.\n\n\n## The occurrence of selective unrest or external tensions could adversely affect the\npolitical and economic stability of India and consequently have an impact on the\nsecurities in which the Scheme invests. Delays or changes in the development of\nconducive policy frameworks could also have an impact on the securities in which the\nScheme invests.\n\n\n## Economic Risk\n\n\n## A slowdown in economic growth or macro-economic imbalances such as the increase\nin central and state level fiscal deficits may adversely affect investments in the country.\nThe underlying growth in the economy is expected to have a direct impact on the\nvolume of new investments in the country.\n\n\n# Foreign Currency Risk\n\n\n## The Scheme may be denominated in Indian Rupees (INR) which is different from the\nhome currency for Foreign Portfolio Investors in the mutual fund units. The INR value\nof investments when translated into home currency by Foreign Portfolio Investors\ncould be lower because of the currency movements. The AMC does not manage\ncurrency risk for Foreign Portfolio Investors and it is the sole responsibility of the\nForeign Portfolio Investors to manage or reduce currency risk on their own. The\nSponsor/Fund/Trustees/ AMC are not liable for any loss to Foreign Investors arising\nfrom such changes in exchange rates.\n\n\n# Settlement Risk (Counterparty Risk) - Specific floating rate assets may also be created\nby swapping a fixed return into a floating rate return. In such a swap, there is the risk\nthat the counterparty (who will pay floating rate return and receive fixed rate return)\n\n\n## 110\n\n\n<!-- Page 111 -->\n\n\n## may default.\n\n\n# Risks associated with transaction in Units through stock exchange(s)\n\n\n# In respect of transaction in Units of the Scheme through stock exchanges, allotment\nand redemption of Units on any Business Day will depend upon the order processing\n/settlement by BSE/NSE and their respective clearing corporations on which the Fund\nhas no control.\n\n\n## Risk related to equity and equity related securities\n\n\n## Equity and equity-related securities are volatile and subject to daily price fluctuations.\nLiquidity in the scheme can be restricted by trading volumes and extended settlement\nperiods, sometimes caused by unforeseen circumstances. If the scheme faces\nsettlement issues, it may miss investment opportunities. Similarly, an inability to sell\nsecurities in the portfolio could lead to potential losses if the value of those securities\ndeclines. Additionally, the scheme's investments may be affected by factors like\ninterest rates, currency exchange rates, changes in laws or government policies,\ntaxation laws, and broader political or economic developments impacting specific\nsectors or the entire market.\n\n\n## Risk associated with short selling and Stock Lending\n\n\n## Securities lending involves lending securities through an approved intermediary to a\nborrower for a specified period, with the condition that equivalent securities will be\nreturned, along with any corporate benefits. Risks include the possibility of\ncounterparty failure, leading to loss of collateral, inability to return the securities, and\nloss of corporate benefits.\n\n\n## Short selling involves selling securities that the seller does not own, borrowing them,\nand later repurchasing them to return to the lender. Risks include counterparty risk and\nliquidity risk, as the borrowed security may become illiquid, forcing the seller to\nrepurchase at a higher price, potentially causing losses.\n\n\n## Risks associated with mid-cap and small-cap companies\n\n\n## Investment in mid-cap and small-cap companies are based on the premise that these\ncompanies have the ability to increase their earnings at a faster pace as compared to\nlarge- cap companies and grow into larger, more valuable companies. However, as with\nall equity investments, there is a risk that such companies may not achieve their\nexpected earnings results, or there could be an unexpected change in the market, both\nof which may adversely affect investment results.\n\nHistorically, it has been observed that as you go down the capitalization spectrum i.e.\n\n\n## 111",

Scheme also invests in mid-cap and small-cap companies\nand hence is exposed to associated risks.\n\n\n# Risk associated with Dividend\n\n\n# Dividend is due only when declared and there is no assurance that a company (even\nthough it may have a track record of payment of dividend in the past) may continue\npaying dividend in future. As such, the schemes are vulnerable to instances where\ninvestments in securities may not earn dividend or where lesser dividend is declared\nby a company in subsequent years in which investments are made by schemes. As the\nprofitability of companies are likely to vary and have a material bearing on their ability\nto declare and pay dividend, the performance of the schemes may be adversely\naffected due to such factors.\n\n\n## Sources of risks in debt funds\n\n\n## Reinvestment Risk\n\n\n## Investments in fixed income securities carry re-investment risk as interest rates\nprevailing on the coupon payment or maturity dates may differ from the original\ncoupon of the bond.\n\n\n# Rating Migration Risk\n\n\n## Fixed income securities are exposed to rating migration risk, which could impact the\nprice on account of change in the credit rating. For example: One notch downgrade of\na AAA rated issuer to AA+ will have an adverse impact on the price of the security and\nvice-versa for an upgrade of a AA+ issuer.\n\n\n## Term Structure of Interest Rates Risk\n\n\n## The Term Structure of Interest Rates Risk affects the Net Asset Value (NAV) of a scheme\ninvested in fixed income securities. When interest rates fall, the value of fixed income\nsecurities rises, and when rates rise, the value declines. This risk is minimal in liquid and\nmoney market funds. However, for Fixed Maturity Funds, the risk does not impact\nreturns for investors who remain invested until maturity.\n\n\n## Credit Risk\n\n\n## Fixed income securities (debt and money market securities) are subject to the risk of\nan issuer's inability to meet interest and principal payments on its debt obligations. The\nInvestment Manager will endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit\nanalysis.\n\n\n## 112",

Further, even among corporate bonds, bonds\nwhich are rated AAA are comparatively less risky than bonds which are AA rated.\n\n\n## The credit risk is the risk that the counter party will default in its obligations and is\ngenerally small as in a Derivative transaction there is generally no exchange of the\nprincipal amount.\n\n\n## Risks associated with Creation of Segregated portfolio\n\n\n## Investor holding units of segregated portfolio may not able to liquidate their holding\ntill the time recovery of money from the issuer. Security comprises of segregated\nportfolio may not realise any value. Listing of units of segregated portfolio on\nrecognised stock exchange does not necessarily guarantee their liquidity. There may\nnot be active trading of units in the stock market. Further trading price of units on the\nstock market may be significantly lower than the prevailing NAV.\n\n\n# Risk Factors Associated with Investments in REITs and InvITS:\n\n\n## REITS and InvITs are exposed to risks such as price risk, interest rate risk, credit risk,\nliquidity risk, reinvestment risk, and the risk of lower-than-expected distributions.\nDistributions depend on the net cash flows available, which are mainly driven by\ndividends, interest, and principal payments from portfolio assets.\n\n\n## However, various risk management strategies are employed to address these risks.\nThese strategies include diversification, regular monitoring of asset performance,\ncredit checks on counterparties, interest rate hedging, and maintaining liquidity buffers\nto ensure smoother cash flows and mitigate the impact of market fluctuations.\n\n\n# Managing Market Liquidity Risk\n\n\n## The liquidity risk is managed by creating a portfolio which has adequate access to\nliquidity. The Investment Manager selects fixed income securities, which have or are\nexpected to have high secondary market liquidity. There is good secondary market\nliquidity in government securities. As far as other long dated fixed income securities\nare concerned, the endeavour is to invest in high quality securities, for example bonds\nissued by public sector entities. Market Liquidity Risk will be managed actively within\nthe portfolio liquidity limits. The first access to liquidity is through cash and fixed\nincome securities.\n\n\n## 113",

Systematic risks, such as inflation, affect the\nentire economy and cannot be mitigated by diversification, making them non-\ndiversifiable or market risks.\n\n\n## Fund managers can reduce unsystematic risk by diversifying across different companies\nbut cannot avoid systematic risks except by staying out of the market.

However, stable markets\nlead to less fluctuation, as seen in funds like overnight funds.\n\n\n## In essence, mutual funds don't carry risk themselves—it's the underlying investments\nthat do.

However, to\nmake a more informed choice, it's essential to assess the consistency of these returns\nand how they compare to the fund's benchmark and peer group. An actively managed\nfund should ideally perform well in rising markets and decline less than its benchmark\nin falling markets.\n\n\n## Simply looking at return figures is not enough for investment decisions; the scheme's\nsuitability to an investor's needs must also factor in associated risks, including the\nvolatility of returns over time.

A fund manager who\ntakes on more risk should achieve higher returns to justify that risk, while a manager\nearning lower returns may be able to justify this by taking less risk. These evaluations\nare often conducted through measures of risk-adjusted returns.\n\n\n# The different kind of risk-adjusted returns are:\n\n\n## (a) Sharpe Ratio\n\nSharpe ratio is a very commonly used measure of risk-adjusted returns.\n\n\n## An investor can invest with the government and earn a risk-free rate of return (R₤). T-\nBill index is a good measure of this risk-free return.\n\nThrough investment in a scheme, a risk is taken, and a return is earned (Rs).\n\n\n## The difference between the two returns i.e. Rs- Rf is called risk premium. It is like a\npremium that the investor has earned for the risk taken, as compared to government's\nrisk-free return.\n\n\n# This risk premium is to be compared with the risk taken. Sharpe Ratio uses Standard\nDeviation as a measure of risk. It is calculated as:\n\n\n## Sharpe Ratio = (Rs minus Rf) ÷ Standard Deviation\n\n\n## Thus, if risk free return is 5 percent, and a scheme with standard deviation of 0.5\npercent earned a return of 7 percent, its Sharpe Ratio would be (7 percent - 5 percent)\n÷ 0.5 percent i.e. 4.\n\n\n## Sharpe Ratio is effectively the risk premium generated by assuming per unit of risk.\nHigher the Sharpe Ratio, better the scheme is considered to be.\n\n\n## Sharpe Ratio comparisons can be undertaken only for comparable schemes. For\nexample, Sharpe Ratio of an equity scheme cannot be compared with the Sharpe\nRatio of a debt scheme.\n\n\n## (b) Treynor Ratio\n\nLike Sharpe Ratio, Treynor Ratio too is a risk premium per unit of risk.\n\n\n## Computation of risk premium is the same as was done for the Sharpe Ratio.

However, such returns on investments or income\nfrom investments maybe subject to tax. The investor would get the income after\nthe payment of taxes. In such a case, it is important to understand the taxation\nassociated with one's investments. This chapter covers taxation in respect of\nmutual funds. As discussed earlier, the mutual fund is an investment vehicle\nthat invests in various investment options. Hence, a distributor of mutual funds\nmust understand the tax applicable on the income of the mutual fund scheme,\nas well as the tax applicable on investments made by an investor in mutual fund\nschemes.\n\n\n## 8.1 Applicability of taxes in respect of mutual funds\n\n\n## 8.1.1 Income from investment in mutual fund units\n\n\n## Investors must consider the effect of taxes on their investment returns. It is not\nhow much you earn, but how much you keep after taxes that counts. As a\nmutual fund is a pass-through vehicle, we must consider the income at two\nlevels-income earned by the fund, and income earned by the investor.\n\n\n## 8.1.2 Income earned by mutual fund schemes\n\n\n## The schemes of the mutual funds invest in marketable securities like shares and\ndebentures.

Apart from this, when the fund buys and sells the shares and\ndebentures in the securities market, there could be capital gains or losses.\nInterest, dividend and capital gains form the income of the mutual fund.\n\n\n# As per the prevailing tax laws in India, a mutual fund's income is exempt from\nincome tax, since mutual funds are constituted as trusts in India for the benefits\nof the unitholders. Section 10(23)(D) of the Income Tax Act exempts all the\nincome earned by the mutual fund schemes from any tax.\n\n8.1.3 Income earned by the investor from investment in mutual fund units\n\n\n## We have already seen that the investor can choose from two options within the\nscheme, viz. (earlier called Dividend) Income Distribution cum Capital\nWithdrawal (IDCW) option and growth. The one who has opted for Income\ndistribution cum capital withdrawal (dividend) may get income in form of\ndividends, whereas the investor in the growth plan would not get any dividend\nwhatsoever, irrespective of the profits earned by the fund.\n\n\n## The investor in the growth plan would earn capital gains (or losses) whenever\none sells the units of the scheme. On the other hand, the investor in the Income\nDistribution cum capital withdrawal (dividend) plan may get dividend, as and\nwhen declared by the fund, as well as capital gains (or losses) when one sells\nthe units.\n\n\n## Both these may have different tax treatment in comparison to the income that\none earns through salary or professional fees and other means. The tax\nstructure is different for different types of investors, as well as for different\ncategories of funds, too.\n\n\n# Let us take a look at the applicable tax rates in case of capital gains and\ndividends. The tax rates would vary as under:\n\n- Type of income: The capital gains are taxed differently in comparison to the\ndividend income (IDCW).\n- Holding period: Capital gains may be categorized as short term and long\nterm based on the holding period. At the same time, within capital gains, short\nterm capital gains may attract different tax rates in comparison to long term\ncapital gains.\n- Type of mutual fund schemes: Income from equity-oriented mutual fund\nschemes is taxed at different rates in comparison to non-equity-oriented\n\n\n## 124",

The schemes holding\nmore than 65 percent of the assets undermanagement in equity shares listed on\nrecognised stock exchanges in India are classified as equity-oriented mutual\nfund schemes. All the other schemes are classified as non-equity-oriented\nschemes. For example, fund-of-funds investing in other equity mutual fund\nschemes, would be classified as non-equity-oriented schemes. Though the said\nscheme is eventually investing in equity assets (equity mutual funds), it is\nclassified as a non-equity-oriented scheme for the purpose of income tax.\n\n- Type of investor: The tax treatment may differ for Resident Indian Investors,\nNRIs, andnon-individual investors. It must be noted that in case of joint holding,\nthe income, beit capital gains or dividend, would be considered to have been\nearned by the first holder.\n- Date of purchase: The union budget 2023 brought some changes in the\ntaxation of capital gains. These changes were applicable from April 1, 2023\nonwards. Investments made prior to that date, i.e., April 1, 2023 would enjoy\nthe old tax structure.\n- Date of redemption: Union budget for the year 2024-25 was presented in the\nparliament in July 2024 after the new government was formed basis the results\nof union elections 2024. To achieve the objective of simplification of taxes, this\nbudget brought about many changes, primarily the tax on capital gains. The new\ntax rules became effective immediately. However, If the units are redeemed\nbefore July 23, 2024, the old tax rates would apply. The new tax rates would be\napplicable for units redeemed on or after July 23, 2024.\n\n\n# 8.2 Capital Gains\n\n\n## When a unitholder sells units of the scheme, the selling price could be different\nfrom the price at which the units were bought. The difference between the\npurchase price of the units and the selling price of the units would be treated\nas capital gain (or loss). If the selling price is higher than the purchase price,\nthere is an incidence of capital gain, whereas if the selling price is lower than\nthe purchase price, there is a capital loss. The capital gains are subject to tax.\nCapital gains tax is classified depending on the period of holding and the type\nof funds invested in.\n\n\n## Capital gains are classified into two categories: short term capital gains and\nlong-term capital gains.

The holding\nperiod for all listed securities as well as for units of equity-oriented funds is 12\nmonths. The holding period for all other assets is 24 months.\n\n\n# Equity mutual funds were exempt from long term capital gains tax earlier. In the\nUnion Budgetof the year 2018, this was changed. Starting April 2018, long term\ncapital gains became taxable. Relating to this, there are two important\nprovisions that are discussed here:\n\n- Grandfathering of capital gains: Since the capital gains from equity assets\nwere non-taxable till the announcement of the budget in 2018, an introduction\nof the tax would have meant that even the gains earned till then would also\nbecome taxable. This is equivalent to introducing tax with retrospective effect.\nIn order to avoid such a situation, the finance minister introduced a clause,\nwhich came to be known as the \"grandfathering of the capital gains\". This\nmeant that the capital gains earned till January 31, 2018 would not be taxable,\nwhich means that for all the equity mutual funds that one has invested in, the\nvaluation as on January 31, 2018 becomes the base point. Gains would be\ncalculated for the purpose of tax by taking the higher of thepurchase price or the\nNAV as on January 31, 2018. The grandfathering benefit was offered in order to\nensure that the effect of the tax is only on a prospective basis and not\nretrospective.\n- The long-term capital appreciation in the various investments in equity-\noriented mutual funds was exempt from tax, as per the prevailing law still the\nabove change. If the appreciation prior to such an announcement was also\nsubject to tax, it would tant amount to retrospective taxation.\n- What this means is that if someone had invested Rs. 1,00,000 in an equity-\noriented mutual fund scheme in 2017 (or any such period prior to the\ngrandfathering date of January 31, 2018) and the value of the investments as\non January 31, 2018 was Rs. 2,00,000.\n\n\n## Scenario: 1\n\n\n## If the investor sells the investments completely and realises a value of Rs.\n1,80,000 on February 9, 2018 then the long-term capital gains for the purpose\nof taxes would be considered to be zero, since the realisedvalue is less than the\nvalue of investments on January 31, 2018 (i.e., the difference between the\nrealised value of Rs. 1,80,000 and the value on January 31, 2018 – Rs. 2,00,000).\n\n\n## 126",

  {
    "page_content": "<!-- Page 127 -->\n\n\n# Scenario 2:\n\n\n# If the investor sells the investments completely and realises a value of Rs.\n2,20,000; the long-term capital gains for the purpose of taxation would be\nconsidered to be Rs. 20,000 (The difference between the realised value of Rs.\n\n2,20,000 and the value on January 31, 2018 – Rs. 2,00,000).\n\n- Exemption up to Rs. 1.25 lakhs: In case of long-term capital gains arising\nout of equity shares and equity-oriented mutual funds, the tax is applicable only\non the capital gainsabove Rs. 1.25 lakhs. The first Rs. 1.25 lakhs worth of long-\nterm capital gain from this category istax-exempt.\n\n\n## For example, if an investor has earned a total long term capital gain worth Rs.\n90,000 in a year, the entire capital gain would be exempt from tax. On the other\nhand, if the total capital gain is Rs. 1,35,000; the first Rs. 1,25,000 would be\nexempt from capital gains tax, but the next Rs. 10,000 would be subject to tax.\n\n\n## 8.3 Dividend income (IDCW option)\n\nDividend income from mutual funds used to be tax-free in the hands of the\n\n\n# investor. There was no tax payable at all, irrespective of how much dividend\none earned. However, the dividend would be paid to the investor after the\ndeduction of dividend distribution tax from the scheme itself. To that extent,\n\n\n## although the dividend was tax-free, the NAV reduced to the extent of the\ndividend as well as the dividend distribution tax. Thus, this tax had an impact on\n\n\n## the investor's after-tax returns.\n\n\n## In the Union Budget presented by the finance minister in February 2020, the\nsituation changed. The dividend distribution tax has been done away with,\n\nwhereas the dividend would henceforth be added to the taxable income of the\n\n\n## assessee for the year. This means the dividends would be taxable in the hands\nof the recipient at the applicable tax rate.\n\n\n# What is the change for those who opted for Income distribution cum capital\nwithdrawal (dividend) option in mutual funds?\nIn the new regime, tax on dividend would be a function of the applicable rate of\ntax based on the total income for the year, and hence the tax rate goes up for\nthose with higher income. This means those who were in higher tax earlier\nmight have paid a lower tax on the dividend income in comparison to their\nnominal rate of tax. This difference goes away. On the other hand, the investors,\nwho were tax-exempt also had to still bear the impact of the dividend\n\n\n## 127",

Now with the changes proposed, the\ndividend income would be tax exempt for investors in various tax-exempt\ncategories, for example charitable trusts, mutual fund schemes and individuals\nin the tax-exempt slab.\n\n\n# Let us understand one important difference between dividend distribution tax\n(old regime) and the tax on dividends in the hands of investors (new regime). The\ndividend distribution taxwas not considered a tax in the hands of the investor,\nand hence it was not available as a setoff against any other tax liability. On the\nother hand, in the new regime, tax on dividends can be reduced through various\nexemptions and adjustments, as applicable.\n\n\n## It must also be noted here that the NAV of the scheme goes down more than\nthe amount received in the hands of the investor.\n\n\n# Post-tax dividend received by the investor = Dividend paid out\nby the scheme - Tax payable thereon, as per the applicable tax\nslab\n\n\n## On the other hand, the growth option works out to be more tax-efficient. Since\nthe mutual fund schemes are tax-exempt, and the capital gains are realized only\nwhen booked, one can allow the gains to run without worrying about tax on the\nsame. This concept is known as deferment of taxes and allows one the benefit\nof compounding before tax.\n\n\n## 8.4 Stamp Duty on Mutual Fund Units\n\n\n## With effect from July 1, 2020, mutual fund units issued against Purchase\ntransactions (whether through lump-sum investments or SIP or STP or switch-\nins or Reinvestment of Income distribution cum capital withdrawal) would be\nsubject to levy of stamp duty* @ 0.005% of the amount invested. 39 Transfer of\nmutual fund units (such as transfers between demat accounts) is subject to\npayment of stamp duty* @ 0.015%.

In the normal course, one would\nexpect that a loss in one head of income can be adjusted (set off) against gains\nin another head of income, since a person is liable to pay tax on the total income\nfor the year. However, there are limitations to such set-off. A few keyprovisions\nhere are:\n\n- Capital loss, short term or long term, cannot be set off against any other\nhead ofincome (e.g., salaries).\n- Short term capital loss is to be set off against short term capital gain or\nlong-term capital gain.\n- Long term capital loss can only be set off against long term capital gain.\n\n\n## Several other factors go into taxation or tax exemption.\n\n\n# 8.6 Securities Transaction Tax\n\n\n## When an investor sells units of an equity fund in the stock exchange, or offers\nthem for re- purchase to the fund, he will have to incur Securities Transaction\nTax (STT) i.e., STT is applicable only on redemption/switch to other\nschemes/sale of units of equity oriented mutual funds whether sold on stock\nexchange or otherwise.\n\n\n## 129",

As the name suggests, this is an equity- linked scheme, and hence\nthe scheme invests in equity shares. The benefit is available up to Rs. 1.50 lacs\nper year per taxpayer in case of individuals and HUFs. The scheme has a lock-in\nperiod of three years from the date of investment.\n\n\n## Let us now understand some nuances of this.\n\n\n## First of all, this is one of the eligible investments under Section 80C, where the\nlimit is to be shared across the eligible avenues. This means if someone has\nexhausted the limit under the said section through some other avenue, any\ninvestment in ELSS would not get any additional tax exemption, but the\ninvestment would still be locked-in for a minimum period of three years.\n\n\n## Second, if one is investing in this scheme through SIP, each investment would\nbe locked-in from the date of the respective investment. The lock-in for the\nentire amount would not getover on completion of 3 years from the date of the\nfirst SIP instalment.\n\nThird, if one opts for (dividend) Income distribution cum capital withdrawal\n\n\n## 130\n\n\n<!-- Page 131 -->\n\n\n# reinvestment plan, each time a dividend is reinvested, the same would also\nattract a 3-year lock-in. Most AMCs have done away with this option in case of\nELSS. They only allow growth option or dividend pay-out.\n\nFourth, the tax benefit would be available to the first holder, in case of a joint holding.\n\n\n## The finance minister, in the Union Budget 2020, proposed two parallel tax\nstructures for the individual taxpayers. There is an old structure, which was\napplicable before the budget was presented that allowed different kinds of\nexemptions and deductions under various sectionsof the Income Tax Act. A\nparallel tax structure has been announced in Union Budget 2020, which has\nmore slabs, and lower rates of taxes for similar slabs. However, under the new\nregime, most exemptions have been removed. Those who opt for this new\nstructure would not be able to take the benefit of tax-saving under Section 80C.\nHence, for these investors, ELSS is just another equity-oriented mutual fund\nscheme that carries a lock-in provision.\n\n\n## There are also a few retirements oriented funds including some that are more\nthan a couple of decades-old which have the benefit of Section 80C. These funds\nhave a lock-in of 5 years and they are meant for accumulation of corpus for a\nperson for their later years. Investing in these funds would also allow the\ninvestor to get a Section 80C deduction. However, one should check whether a\nspecific retirement fund has this benefit because not all of them in operation\nhave this Section 80C benefit.\n\n\n## 8.8 Tax Deducted at Source\n\n\n## There is no TDS on re-purchase proceeds to resident investors. However, for\ncertain cases of non-resident investments, the same is applicable. The income\ntax regulations prescribe different rates, depending on the nature of the\ninvestor (Indian/ Foreign and Individual/Institutional), nature of investment\n(equity/debt) and nature of the income (dividend/capital gain). In case of\ndividends (IDCW) from mutual fund schemes, even for resident Indians, TDS is\napplicable. The tax is required to be deducted at 10 percent on the dividend\namount if it exceeds Rs. 5,000.\n\n\n## Further, Government of India has entered into Double Taxation Avoidance\nAgreements (DTAA) with several countries. These agreements too, specify rates\nfor Withholding Tax.\n\n\n# The TDS applicable for non-resident investors is the lower of the rate specified\nin the income tax regulations or the tax specified in the DTAA of the country\nwhere the investor is resident. The investor, however, will need to provide\n\n\n## 131",

They also know what not to expect in terms of services.\n\n\n## We would look at various investor services involved at various stages in the life of a\nmutual fund investment.\n\n\n## 9.1 The NFO process\n\n\n# New Fund Offer\n\n\n# Units in a mutual fund scheme are offered to investors for the first time through a New\nFund Offer (NFO). The following are a few key steps leading to the NFO:\n\n- The Asset Management Company (AMC) decides on a scheme to take to the market.\nThis is decided on the basis of inputs from the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) on\ninvestment objectives that would benefit investors, and inputs from the Chief\nMarketing Officer (CMO) on the interest in the market for the investment objectives.\n\n\n## 134",

Hence the NFO has to be in a category where\nthe AMC does not already have a fund/scheme. Or, it has to be in a category where an\nAMC can have multiple funds/schemes e.g. Sector/Theme, Index or Fund of Funds.\n\n- AMC prepares the Scheme Information Document for the NFO. This needs to be\napproved by the Trustees and the Board of Directors (BoD) of the AMC.\n- The documents are then filed with SEBI. The observations that SEBI makes on the\nSID need to be incorporated. After approval by the trustees, the same can be issued in\nthemarket.\n- The AMC decides on a suitable timetable for the issue, keeping in mind the market\nsituation.\n- The AMC launches its advertising and public relations campaigns to make investors\naware of the NFO. These need to comply with SEBI's advertising code.\n- The AMC holds events for intermediaries and the press to make them familiar with\nthe scheme, its unique features, benefits for investors, etc.\n- The Scheme Documents and Application Forms are distributed to market\nintermediaries, and circulated in the market so that investors can apply in the NFO.\n\n\n## Three dates are relevant for the NFO of an open-ended scheme:\n\nNFO Open Date - This is the date from which investors can invest in the NFO\n\nNFO Close Date - This is the date up to which investors can invest in the NFO\n\n\n## Scheme Re-Opening Date - This is the date from which the investors can offer their\nunits for re-purchase to the scheme (at the re-purchase price); or buy new units of the\nscheme (at thesale price). The AMC announces Sale and Re-purchase prices from the\nScheme Re-Opening Date.\n\n\n## Close-ended Schemes have an NFO Open Date and NFO Close Date. But they have no\nScheme Re-opening Date, because the scheme does not sell or re-purchase units.\nInvestors will needto buy or sell units from the stock exchange where the scheme is\nlisted.\n\n\n## Under the SEBI guidelines, NFOs other than ELSS can remain open for a maximum of 15\ndays.\n\n\n## 9.2 New Fund Offer Price/On-going Offer Price for subscription\n\n\n## New Fund Offer (NFO) Price is the price per unit that the investors have to pay to invest\nduringthe NFO.\n\n\n## 135",

Investors have a choice of\ngoing through the distributors or invest directly through the AMC. Since the\ndistribution services involve charges with respect to the various services provided by\nthe distributor, any investorgoing direct is assumed to have decided not to avail those\nservices. In such a case, the investormay not bear the cost of such services. Each mutual\nfund has to offer two plans to the investors, viz., regular plan and direct plan. Both\nthese would have different total expense ratio (TER).\n\n\n## The direct plan shall have a lower expense ratio excluding distribution expenses,\ncommission, etc., and no commission shall be paid from such plans. Since the TER is\ndifferent in both cases,the plans will have separate NAVs.\n\n\n## It must be clearly understood that the direct plan is only for those investors, who\npurchase units directly from the fund and the same is not available for investors who\nroute their investments through a distributor. If investment (purchase/repurchase) is\nrouted through a distributor, then it is considered that one has chosen to invest in the\nRegular Plan.\n\n\n## Apart from these two plans at different NAVs, the AMC cannot offer separate plans\nbased on expense ratio.\n\n\n## 9.3.2 Income Distribution cum capital withdrawal (Dividend) Pay-out, Income\nDistribution cum capital withdrawal (Dividend) Re-Investment and Growth Options\n\n\n## —\n\n\n# Most mutual fund schemes offer two options Income Distribution cum capital\nwithdrawal (Dividend) and Growth. A third option, which is possible, is the Re-investment\nof Income Distribution cum capital withdrawal (Dividend) re-investment Option. From\nApril 1, 2021 the dividend option has been renamed to Income Distribution cum capital\nwithdrawal to reflect the actual situation about the income earned by the investor.\nThese are different options within a scheme having the same portfolio. Therefore, the\nportfolio returns are the same for all three options. However, they differ in the\nstructure of cash flows and income accruals for the unit-holder, and therefore there is\n\n\n## 136",

  {
    "page_content": "<!-- Page 137 -->\n\n\n## a difference in the unitholder's taxability, number of units held and value of those units.\nThe post-tax return from each of these options will therefore be different.\n\n\n# In a Pay-out of Income Distribution cum capital withdrawal plan, the fund declares a\ndividend from time to time. Some schemes (liquid and debt funds with very short-\nterm maturity) even declare a dividend daily, subject to the availability of profits. When\na dividend is paid, the NAV of the units falls to that extent.\n\n\n## The reduced NAV, after a Pay-out of Income distribution cum capital withdrawal, is\ncalled ex-Dividend NAV. After a dividend is announced, and until it is paid out, it is\nreferred to as cum-Dividend NAV.\n\n\n## In a Pay-out of Income Distribution cum capital withdrawal (Income distribution cum\ncapital withdrawal) option, the investor receives the dividend in his bank account.\nHowever, the Pay-out of Income distribution cum capital withdrawal plan does not\nchange the number of units held by the investor.\n\n\n## The dividend received in the hands of the investor will be taxed in the hands of the\ninvestor,as per the current tax laws. In addition, the nature of the income which the\nmutual fund hasto provide a break up for will determine the head under which this is\ntaxed.\n\n\n## In an Income Distribution cum capital withdrawal (dividend) re-investment option, as\nin the case of pay-out option, NAV declines to the extent of dividend. The resulting NAV\nis called ex-dividend NAV, like in case of Pay-out of Income Distribution cum capital\nwithdrawal plan.\n\n\n## However, the investor does not receive the dividend in his bank account; the amount\nis re-invested in the same scheme and additional units are allotted to the investor. The\nreinvestment happens at the ex-dividend NAV. Thus, if dividend is Rs 2 per unit on a\nUnit- holder's 100 units, the dividend would amount to Rs 200. Assuming the ex-\ndividend NAV of the scheme is Rs 20, then Rs 200 ÷ Rs 20 i.e., 10 units will be added to\nthe unit-holder's portfolio.\n\n\n## In a growth option, dividend is not declared. Therefore, nothing is received in the bank\naccount (unlike Income Distribution cum capital withdrawal pay-out option) and there\nis nothing to re-invest (unlike Income Distribution cum capital withdrawal re-\ninvestment option). The NAV would therefore capture the full value of the portfolio\ngains. As in the case of Income Distribution cum capital withdrawal pay-out option,\nthere will be no accretion to the number of units held. The NAV of those units will\nhowever be higher, to reflect the gain in the portfolio.\n\nAcross the three options, the investor can also receive money by offering his/her units\n\n\n## 137",

Thus, an investor who has invested Rs. 12,000, in a scheme where\nthe applicable sale price isRs 12, will be allotted Rs 12,000\\divRs 12 i.e., 1,000 units.\n\n\n## In a rights issue, the price at which the units are offered is clear at the time of\ninvestment.

It provides access\nto banking services anywhere and at any time through the official website of the\nbanking institution. Net banking allows fund transfers to own and third-party accounts,\nonline bill payments, online shopping and other such facilities that involves making and\nreceiving payments. The National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) facility allows the\ndigital transfer of funds between bank accounts. The Immediate Payment Service\n(IMPS) is an instant interbankelectronic fund transfer available to registered users of\nbanks through mobile phones, net banking and ATMs.\n\n\n## Remittance can also be made directly to the bank account of the scheme through Real\nTime Gross Settlement (RTGS)/National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) facilities (for\ntransfers within India) or SWIFT transfer (for transfers from abroad). While RTGS\ntransfers are instantaneous, NEFT transfers are batched together in the banking\nsystem and effected at various times during the day. SWIFT transfers tend to pass\nthrough multiple banks in different geographies, and multiple levels within the same\nbank, resulting in delays. All banks and their branches are not enabled to provide\nelectronic transfer facilities.\n\n\n## Before money is remitted directly to the mutual fund, it is advisable to get the proper\nbank account details from the AMC/distributor. The details of the mutual fund, such\nas account number, account name, IFSC details etc. are required to do an electronic\ntransfer. Some mutual funds may provide this information in the application form. The\nbank will generate a unique transaction reference number. The acknowledgement\nfrom the bank for the transferrequest has to be appended along with the application\nas proof of transfer. The account number mentioned in the transfer instruction copy\nprovided as proof should have the first holder as one of the account holders.\n\n\n## National Automated Clearing House (NACH) is a centralised clearing system launched\nby the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). NACH aims to replace and\nconsolidate multiple existing Electronic Clearing Service (ECS) systems across India and\ncreate a faster and more efficient clearing platform. It is a web-based solution for\nBanks, Financial Institutions, Corporate and Governments, to facilitate interbank high\nvolume, electronic transactions which are repetitive and periodic in nature. This has\nbeen introduced in place of ECS for repetitive payments. NACH have same day\npresentation and settlement, including returns processing.\n\n\n# The various facilities offered by NACH include standardisation and digitisation of\nmandates, overall simplification, reduction of operational cost, and minimisation of\nactivation time.

Not only this, NACH is\nuseful for corporate and financial institutions that make payments in bulk like dividend\ndistributions, salaries, interests, pensions, etc.\n\n\n## M-Banking i.e., mobile banking is another convenient way for investment and\ntransaction purpose.\n\nStock exchange platform and MFU platform are also used for purchase transactions.\n\n\n# Unified Payment Interface\n\n\n## The Unified Payment Interface (UPI) allows fund transfer between accounts through\nthe mobile app. The users have to register for a mobile banking facility to be able to\nuse the app.There are many UPI apps available such as BHIM, banking applications,\nAadhaar app etc. which one can download on their phone. After the application (app)\nis downloaded, a VirtualPayment Address (VPA) has to be created by going through an\nauthentication process. This islike an email address and links the UPI app to the user's\nbank account through the mobile phone registered with the bank. The VPA can be\nchanged if so desired. Multiple bank accountscan be linked to a VPA, but one account\nhas to be designated as the default account. To make payments using the UPI, one\nneeds the VPA of the payee. The user can also receive funds using the UPI. A new\nversion of the UPI allows the transfer of funds using the Aadhaar number instead of a\nVPA.\n\n\n## Application Supported by Blocked Amount\n\n\n## Application Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA) is a facility where the investment\napplication in a New Fund Offer (NFO) is accompanied by an authorization to the bank\nto block the amount of the application money in the investor's bank account.\n\n\n## The benefit of ASBA is that the money goes out of the investor's bank account only on\nan allotment. Until then, it keeps earning interest for the investor. Further, since the\nmoney transferred from the investor's bank account is the exact application money\nthat is due on account of the allotment, the investor does not have to wait for any\nrefund.\n\n\n## 153",

Most leading banks support this\nservice. NUUP is currently available in 11 regional languages.\n\n\n## Cards\n\n\n## Cards are the most commonly used mode of digital payments. Debit cards are issued by\nbanksto their account holders and allow card holders to carry out fund transactions\nlinked to their bank account. Credit cards are issued by banks and other approved\nentities and allow credit card holders to use the card up to approved credit limits.\nPrepaid cards can also be used to make card payments. The cards are used by swiping\nit at the merchants' POS device. A PIN may be required to confirm the transaction in\ncase of a debit card. Online payments can also be made using cards. The drawback is\nthat the merchant may have to pay a charge on each transaction done through credit\ncards. Mutual funds purchases using credit cards are not allowed.\n\n\n## E-Wallets\n\n\n# E-Wallets are a virtual or digital version of the physical wallet.

The debits happen through the National Automated Clearing\nHouse (NACH).It eliminates the need for the investor to initiate payment every time a\npurchase transaction is conducted. It is a one-time process to register a bank account\nunder this facility. An existing investor can fill up the OTM form to register a bank\naccount and hand it over to the Investor Service Centre for processing. A new investor\ncan submit the OTM form along with the application form for subscription. The OTM\nmandate requires the bank name, bank account number, account type, IFSC and MICR\ncode to be provided to identify the account to be registered. A cancelled cheque or\ncopy with the name and account number pre-printed on it has to accompany the\napplication form for verification of the account details. The folio number for existing\ninvestors and the application form number for new investors have to be provided\nalong with the email id and phone number. Investors can select the frequency at which\ndebit can be made, monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or 'As and when presented' and\nspecify the fixed amount that can be debited. The mandate also allows account holders\nto specify the maximum amount that can be debited on a daily basis and select the\ncategory- 'As and when presented' under the frequency parameter to enable\nmultiple SIP or other purchase debits under the folio. For example, investors can\nmandate an amount of Rs.5000/-that can be debited as and when presented. There is\nno limit on number of transactions as long as the total amount is within the daily\nmaximum limit specified in the mandate. The period for which the mandate will be\nvalid should also be specified in the form. The name(s) and signatures of the bank\naccount holders have to be affixed on the form.

This is much faster because the various processes\nmentioned earlier for payment by cheque, are obviated. A Direct Credit from the\nmutual fund's account to thatof the investor can be done provided the investor holds\nan account with a bank with which the mutual fund has the arrangement to make direct\ncredits. Other electronic modes include RTGS/NEFT/NACH etc. Details such as the\naccount number, branch address, IFSC/MICR code have to be provided to the mutual\nfund to enable credit to the bank accounts of investors of redemption amounts and\ndividends. This information is collected at the time of making the application.\nElectronic modes may not be available to all investors, depending upon their\ngeographic location and/or the bank and branch with which they hold their account.\nIn such cases, cheques and demand drafts will be used to make payments to the\ninvestors.\n\n\n## The redemption proceeds will be paid in favour of the sole/first holder of the folio. If\nthe proceeds are paid by cheque, then the same will be sent to the unitholders address.\n\n\n## For units held in dematerialized form, the redemption proceeds will be paid into the\nbank account registered with the DP.\n\n\n## It may be noted that for non-resident investors, payment is made by the AMC in\nrupees. In case the investment has been made on a repatriable basis, and the investor\nwishes to transfer the money abroad, the costs associated with converting the rupees\ninto any foreign currency would be to the account of the investor. Proceeds of\ninvestments made on a repatriable basiscan be credited to an NRE or FCNR account, as\nrequired by the investor. In case of redemptions by NRIs there will also be tax deducted\nat source as applicable.\n\n\n# Mutual funds provide investors the facility to register multiple bank accounts to\nfacilitate receiving the redemption, dividends and any other payouts from the fund.

Systematic transactions,\nsuch as systematic investments, withdrawals and transfers, enable periodic\ninvestments and withdrawals that investors can align to the available investible surplus,\nneed for regular fundsor rebalancing the investments to manage risks. Signing up for\nsystematic transactions also enables these transactions to be executed without the\nintervention of the investor every time, thus protecting the portfolio from investor\n\n\n## inertia.\n\n\n## 9.11.1 Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)\n\n\n## It is considered a good practice to invest regularly, particularly in volatile markets such\nas equity markets. SIP is an approach where the investor invests constant amounts at\nregular intervals. A benefit of such an approach, particularly in equity schemes, is that\nit averages theunitholder's cost of acquisition since more units are bought for the same\namount of investment when the price/markets are down and fewer units when the\nprice/markets are up.\n\n\n## Suppose an investor were to invest Rs 1,000 per month for 6 months. If, in the first\nmonth, the NAV is Rs 10, the investor will be allotted Rs 1,000 ÷ Rs 10 i.e., 100 units. In\n\n\n# the second month, if the NAV has gone up to Rs 12, the allotment of units will go down\nto Rs 1,000\\divRs~12 i.e., 83.333 units. If the NAV goes down to Rs 9 in the following\nmonth, the unit-holder willbe allotted a higher number of Rs 1,000 ÷ Rs 9 i.e., 111.111\n\n\n## units.\n\n\n## Thus, the investor acquires his units at lower than the average of the NAV on the 6\ntransactiondates during the 6 months – a reason why this approach is also called Rupee\nCost Averaging. Systematic investing allows investors to buy into a volatile market\novertime at an average price without having to predict market movements.\n\n\n## It is easier for investors to generate the smaller amounts required to invest through a\nperiodicinvestment plan than the large sums required to make lump sum investments.\nSaving for goals becomes easier when investible surpluses are periodically invested.\n\n\n## Mutual funds make it convenient for investors to lock into SIPS by investing through\nPost-Dated Cheques (PDCs), NACH or Standing Instructions (SI).\n\nAn SIP can be used to initiate a fresh purchase in a scheme and open a folio or make\n\n\n## 175",

An SIP can also be\ninitiated during a New Fund Offer(NFO).\n\n\n# 9.11.2 Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP)\n\n\n## Just as investors do not want to buy all their units at a market peak, they do not want\nto riskredeeming all their units in a market trough. Investors can therefore opt for the\nsafer route of offering for re-purchase a constant value of units over a period of time.\n\n\n## Suppose an investor registers to withdraw Rs. 1,000 per month for 6 months. If in the\nfirst month, the NAV is Rs 10, the investor's unit-holding will be reduced by Rs. 1,000 ÷\nRs. 10 i.e.,100 units. In the second month, if the NAV has gone up to Rs. 12, the unit-\nholding will go downby fewer units viz. Rs. 1,000\\divRs . 12 i.e., 83.333 units. If the NAV\ngoes down to Rs 9 in the following month, the unit-holder will be offering for re-\npurchase a higher number of units viz.Rs 1,000\\divRs9 i.e., 111.111 units.\n\n\n# Thus, the investor re-purchases his units at an average NAV during the 6-month period.\nThe investor does not end up in the unfortunate position of exiting all the units in a\nmarket trough. Since units are being redeemed, exit loads and taxes will apply. The\n\neffect of exit loads will increase the number of units that needs to be redeemed to\n\nwithdraw a fixed amount of money since it reduces the effective price for the investor.\n\nIn the earlier example, if there was an exit load of 1 percent then the first tranche of\n\nwithdrawal when the NAV is at Rs.10 will be for 101.0101 units since the exit load of 1\n\npercentreduces the applicable NAV for the investor to Rs.9.90 from the Rs.10. In order\n\n\n## to get Rs.1000the investor, therefore, has to redeem 101.0101 units.\n\nMutual funds make it convenient for investors to manage their SWPS by registering\n\n\n## the\n\n\n## amount, periodicity (generally, monthly) and period for their SWP. Some schemes even\noffer the facility of transferring only the appreciation or the dividend.\n\n\n# In this option, the withdrawal is not fixed but will vary depending upon the availability\nof appreciation in the specific investment chosen by the investor. The advantage of a\nvariable SWP relative to a fixed amount of withdrawal is that the capital invested will\nnot be withdrawn. Depending upon the type of SWP chosen the mutual fund will re-\npurchase or redeem the appropriate number of units of the unit-holder, without the\nformality of having togive a re-purchase instruction for each transaction. An investor\nmay opt for SWP for several reasons:\n\n\n## 176",

    "page_content": "<!-- Page 177 -->\n\n- To minimise the risk of redeeming all the units during a market trough.\n- Meet liquidity needs for regular expenses.\n- Assuming the scheme is profitable, the re-purchase ensures that some of the\nprofits arebeing regularly encashed by the investor.\n\n\n# 9.11.3 Systematic Transfer Plan (STP)\n\n\n## This is a variation of SWP. While in a SWP the constant amount is paid to the investor\nat the pre-specified frequency, in a STP, the amount that is withdrawn from a scheme\n(called the source scheme) is re-invested in some other scheme (called the target\nscheme) of the same mutual fund. Thus, it operates as a SWP from the source scheme,\nand a SIP into the target scheme. Since the investor is effectively switching between\nschemes, it is also called \"switch\"if it is just one transaction or tranche. If there are\nmultiple tranches over a fixed period on pre-defined date of an amount that is defined\nahead, then it is an STP. The transfer of funds from the source scheme is equivalent to\nredemption. Exit loads and taxes will apply like any other redemption transactions. The\nminimum investment and redemption limits specified by the mutual fund for the\nschemes will not apply to an STP. The mutual fund will also specify the source schemes\nfrom which the switch/transfer can be made and the target schemes into which the\nswitch/transfer can be made. If the unit-holder were to do this SWP and SIP as separate\ntransactions.\n\n- The Unit-holder ends up waiting for funds during the time period that it takes\nto receive the re-purchase proceeds, and has idle funds, during the time it takes\nto re-invest in the second scheme. During this period, the market movements\ncan be adverse for the unit- holder.\n- The Unit-holder has to do two sets of paper work (Redeem and Purchase) for\nevery period.\n\n\n## The STP offered by mutual funds is a cost-effective and convenient facility. It can be\nused by investors to make periodic investments into a volatile market such as equity,\nor to rebalancea portfolio, or to book profits. Investors can choose to transfer a fixed\namount each period or to transfer the appreciation in a scheme.\n\n\n## Example\n\n\n## An investor who holds lump sum amount of Rs.10 lakhs in a short-term debt fund and\nregisters for an STP to transfer Rs.100000 each month over 10 instalments to a\ndiversified equity scheme of the same mutual fund. There is an exit load of 0.25\npercent on redemptionfrom the short-term debt fund up to three months from the\ndate of allotment and no exit load thereafter.\n\nThe first 3 instalments of Rs.1,00,000 transferred will be after the exit load of 0.25\n\n\n## 177",

After the third instalment, there\nwill be no exit load and thefull amount of Rs.1,00,000 will be transferred. Any return\nearned on the short-term debt fund will be taxed as applicable.\n\n\n# 9.11.4 Switch\n\n\n## A switch is a redemption from one scheme and a purchase into another combined into\none transaction. For example, investors who believe that equity markets have peaked\nand want to book profits can switch out from an equity scheme and switch into a short-\nterm debt fund.\n\n\n## 9.11.5 Transfer of Income distribution cum capital withdrawal plan (dividend transfer\nplan)\n\n\n## Transfer of Income distribution cum capital withdrawal plan ((dividend transfer plan)\n(DTP) is a facility that allows investors to invest the dividend earned ina mutual fund\ninvestment into another scheme of the same mutual fund. Investors with a lowrisk\nprofile can get some benefits of diversification by transferring dividends earned from\ndebt funds into equity funds. Similarly, dividends earned in equity funds can be\ntransferred into debt funds to rebalance the portfolio and manage risks. Mutual funds\ndecide the schemes, plans and options from which the dividends can be transferred\nand the target schemes to which they can be transferred.\n\n\n## The investor must hold units in the Income distribution cum capital withdrawal\n(dividend) option of a scheme to sign up for this facility. Once the investor registers a\nDTP, any existing instruction for Income distribution cum capital withdrawal or\ndividend re-investment will be overridden. All the units held under the scheme, plan\nand option selected for DTP will be covered under the transfer. The investor has to\nclearly identify the source scheme, plan and option from which the transfer has to be\nmade and the target scheme, plan and option to which the dividend should be\ntransferred. The units in the target scheme will be held in the same folio as the source\nscheme. The minimum application amount specified for the target scheme will not\napply to investments made under a DTP. The mutual fund may specify a minimum\namount of dividend that can be transferred. The dividend is invested in the target\nscheme on the next business day after the record date for the Income distribution cum\ncapital withdrawal in the source scheme.\n\n\n# Mutual funds may require the DTP enrolment form to be registered a specific number\nof days before the record date for the dividend. The DTP mandate will stand\nautomatically terminated when the unit holding in the source scheme becomes nil. It can\n\n\n## 178",

The\nfund alsospecifies the minimum investment for each tranche, the dates on which the\ntransactions canbe conducted and the minimum period for which the investor can sign\nup. From the availableoptions, the investor can choose the amount of the periodic\ntransaction, the frequency (monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, annual), the period over\nwhich the transaction will be doneand the dates. In case of a minor investor, however,\n\n\n## the SIP will be registered only till the dateof the minor attaining majority even though\nthe instructions may be for a period beyond thedate of majority. A default SIP date,\nfrequency, end date may be specified by the scheme which will be applied in case the\ninvestor does not make a selection. Mutual funds may also offer the facility to increase\nthe instalment amount periodically.\n\n\n## A new investor has to submit both the application form as well as the SIP enrollment\nform toregister for an SIP. The information provided in both forms have to tally. In case\nof an existing investor only the SIP enrollment form has to be submitted. The\nenrollment form requires thenames, PAN and KYC compliance of all the holders of the\nfolio and their signatures. For existing investors only, the folio number needs to be\nprovided. The enrollment form has to be signed asper the mode of holding of the existing\nfolio. The investment details to be provided in the formincludes the scheme, plan and\noption selected. The SIP details to be provided are the SIP amount, frequency, SIP date\nand the start and end date for the SIP period. The details of the bank account that is\nregistered for NACH/Direct Debit/Standing Instructions for the SIP should be provided\nin the form. The information available under the folio, such as unitholder detailsand\nmode of holding, will apply to the SIP investments also. The signature of the investor\nin the application form/folio records and enrollment form has to be the same. In case\nthe existingfolio is operated jointly then the SIP form has to be signed by all the holders.\n\n\n## The enrollment form has to be submitted to the mutual fund a specified number of\ndays before the first instalment, typically 15 to 30 days. For example, assume a mutual\nfund requires a registration time of 30 days for an SIP enrollment. An investor submits\nan enrollment form on 5^{th} September and selects 15^{th} as the SIP date. The first\ninstalment will be 15th of October since 30 days are required for registration. The\nenrollment time may come down if investors already have a One-Time Mandate (OTM)\nregistered in the folio for makingpayments.\n\n\n## The payment modes accepted for SIPs include post-dated cheques and electronic\npayment modes such as NACH, direct debit and standing instructions (SI).

Direct debit and Standing\nInstructions are facilities that the investor can use ifthey hold an account with a bank\nand in a branch that has a tie-up with the mutual fund. The. first instalment should\naccompany the enrollment form. This can either be through a cheque drawn on the\nbank which is registered for NACH/Direct Debit/SI for the SIP, or any other bank\nprovided a photocopy of a cheque drawn on the bank registered for the electronic\npayment is also enclosed with the enrollment form. Alternatively, the first instalment\nneed not be paidby cheque, if the enrollment form is attested by the bank which is\nregistered for debiting theinstalments.\n\n\n## SIP Top-up Facility\n\n\n## Mutual funds provide an additional facility through an SIP to enhance the disciplined\nsavingsof investors. It is called the SIP Top-Up facility. Investors have the option to\nincrease the SIP amount at intervals chosen by them. The increase can be of a fixed\namount or a percentage of the existing SIP amount. For example, assume an investor\nhas registered for a monthly SIPof Rs.2500 for a 3-year period and has also signed up to\ntop-up the SIP at an annual frequencyby Rs.500. In the first year the SIP instalment will\nbe Rs. 2500. The second-year each monthlyinstalment will be increased by Rs. 500 to Rs.\n3000 and in the third year it will go up to Rs.3500.If the investor had instead signed up\nfor a 10 percent annual increase, then the SIP instalmentgoes up to Rs.2750 (2500 +10\npercent of 2500) in the second year and Rs.3025 (2750+ 10 percent of 2750) in year 3.\nThe top-up facility helps investors increase their savings with time as income and\ninvestible surpluses go up. Investors have the option to either set an upper limitfor the\nSIP with the Top-up facility or the date from which the SIP Top-Up amount will cease.\nOnce it reaches the pre-defined upper limit or the pre-defined date, the Top-up facility\nis discontinued. However, the SIP amount along with the Top-up amount will remain\nconstant till the end of the SIP tenure.\n\n\n## Investors register for the Top-up facility at the time of enrolling for the SIP. An existing\nSIP investor can also register for a Top-up facility. The details of the existing SIP, such\nasscheme/plan, frequency, duration and amount have to be correctly provided while\nregisteringfor the top-up facility. Mutual funds may not offer the Top-up facility for\nMicro-SIPs or it maybe subject to the condition that the SIP amount and the Top-Up\ntogether does not exceed Rs.50,000 in a rolling 12-month period or financial year.\n\n\n## 180\n\n\n<!-- Page 181 -->\n\n\n# Renewal and Cancellation of SIP\n\n\n## To renew an SIP, a renewal form has to be submitted giving details of the scheme, plan\nand option, SIP amount, SIP date and period.\n\n\n# An SIP can be cancelled by giving due notice of the same to the AMC by providing\ndetails of the SIP such as folio number, scheme name, option, bank details and mode\nof payment. The period of notice required will be specified by the AMC. The bank\nmandate, in case of electronic payment mode, also has to be cancelled. An SIP may\nalso stand cancelled if there are insufficient funds in the bank account when payment\nis due.\n\n\n## Registration and Cancellation of SWP\n\n\n## In case of systematic withdrawals, the investor has to register the SWP with the mutual\nfund and specify details such as the scheme, plan, option, amount of withdrawal,\nfrequency and the period of the SWP. The selections have to be made from the options\nprovided by the mutual fund. The mutual fund may specify a minimum period before\nthe first withdrawal before which the enrollment form has to be submitted. The credits\nwill be made to the default bank account, or any other account as required by the\ninvestor and registered with the mutual fund. The mutual fund may specify the\nminimum amounts for each tranche of a systematic withdrawal transaction. Typically,\nthis is lower than what is specified for a redemption from the scheme.\n\n\n## An SWP will stand cancelled when all the units are redeemed. Investors can choose to\ncance SWP by giving notice in writing to the mutual fund giving full details of the\nmandate such as scheme name, plan, option, folio details, SWP amount, frequency and\nperiod.\n\n\n## Registering and Cancellation of STP and Switches\n\n\n## In case of systematic transfers and switches, the source and target schemes have to be\nselected at the time of registering the STP or Switch. The schemes from and to which\ntransfersand switches can be made are defined by the mutual fund. The minimum\namount of transfer is also fixed by the mutual fund. The frequency, number of\ninstalments and the dates of the transfer are selected by the investor in the form for\nregistering the STP. Mutual funds will require a notice period for registering and\ncancelling the STP.\n\n\n# A Switch instruction will be given by the investor using the Transaction slip.

In case of transfers, each leg of the transfer (redemption and\npurchase) will be executed at the applicable NAV for each scheme. The investor will\nhave to bear the loads and taxes as applicable. A systematic transaction can be\ncancelled at any time by givingthe mutual fund notice in writing.\n\n\n## Triggers\n\n\n## It is not uncommon for investors to rue missed opportunities of buying or selling because\ntheycould not give the requisite instructions in time. This is addressed through the\ntrigger option that is offered by some mutual funds.\n\n\n## For instance, an investor can book profits by specifying that the units would be re-\npurchased if the market reaches a particular level. In that case, once the market\nreaches that level, theunits would be re-purchased, without the need for going through\na separate re-purchase documentation. It stands to reason that if the market continues\nto go up after the trigger is activated, the investor loses on the further gain. A date\ntrigger instructs the mutual fund to redeem the units specified on a particular date. Or,\nthe investor could set a stop-loss trigger by identifying the level of the NAV or the\npercentage depreciation in the value of the investment at which the investment should\nbe redeemed so that the investment is protectedfrom a further fall in value.\n\n\n# Similarly, an investor can set a trigger to transfer money into an equity scheme when\nthe market goes down, say 20 percent, or the transfer can be triggered by a fall in the\nNAV of the equity scheme by a defined percentage. This would help the investor\nconveniently increase his position in equities, when the markets decline. Typically,\ntriggers are set on the value of indices or the investment. Investors can choose to\nredeem just the appreciation or the entireholding value on the activation of the trigger\nor a percentage of the current value of the investment. Investors will choose this\ndepending upon the type of trigger. For example, a stop loss trigger may go with\nredeeming the entire investment value while an appreciation triggermay be paired\nwith redeeming the amount of appreciation. Investors may also choose to switch to\nanother scheme on the activation of the trigger. Mutual funds decide the type of\ntriggers that will be offered and the schemes on which they will be offered. For each\ninvestment under a folio, a separate trigger facility request has to be made. A notice\n\n\n## 182",

In case of a folio held in the name of a single\nindividual, the nomination is required unless the holder specifically confirms\ntheir intent not to nominate at the time of making the application. In the case\nof joint holding, every unit-holder will have to sign the nomination form,\nirrespective of the mode of holding. Only individual investors can make a\nnomination.

This is affected through a Pledge Form executed by the unit-holder\n(pledger). Theform has a provision for specifying the party in whose favour the units\nare pledged (pledgee). The units that are offered as security for a loan should have\ncompleted the lock-in period if any. All the unit-holders, irrespective of the mode of\nholding, of the folio, must sign the form requesting the marking of the lien in favour of\nthe lender. The form should clearly state the name of the unit-holder(s) as it appears\nin the folio, identify the scheme, plan and option andthe number of units on which the\nlien should be marked. A non-individual entity must enclose a board resolution and\nother authorization for the person pledging the units. Once units are pledged, the Unit-\nholder/s cannot sell or switch out the pledged units, until the pledgee givesa written\nno-objection to release the pledge. As long as the lien is marked, the lender will have\nthe authority to enforce the pledge and redeem units after providing the documents\nnecessary for the same.

The benefit of holding investments in\ndemat form is that investors' purchase and sale of investments get automatically added\nor subtracted from their investment demat account, without having to execute\ncumbersome paperwork. Settlement of most transactions in the stock exchange needs\nto be compulsorily done in demat form.\n\n\n## In order to avail this facility, the investor needs to open a demat account with a\ndepository participant. The access of demat facility for mutual fund investors has\nincreased, with NationalStock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange making available\nscreen-based platforms for purchase and sale of mutual fund schemes.\n\n\n# Mutual funds are required to provide investors the option to hold the units in demat\nform.

It regulates, among other entities, mutual funds,\ndepositories, custodians, registrars and transfer agents (RTAs) and credit rating\nagencies in the country.\n\n\n## The Preamble of the Securities and Exchange Board of India describes the basic\nfunctions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India as \"...to protect the interests\nof investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate the\nsecurities market and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto\".\n\n\n## The regulations cover three important aspects to achieve the above objectives:\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Disclosures by issuers of securities, e.g. companies that issue shares or\ndebentures, and mutual funds that issue mutual fund units\n\n\n## Efficiency of transactions in the securities markets\n\n\n## Low transaction costs\n\n\n## Apart from the above, various other areas also warrant regulations, such as:\n\n- Deliberate speculation in stock markets\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Insider trading\n\n- Excessive risks taken by mutual funds\n\n\n## ·\n\n\n## Inadequate collateral by issuers of debt securities\n\n\n## If such activities are unchecked, the trust of the investors would be lost in the\nfunctioning of the markets, which eventually may lead to drying up of precious\nfinancial resources. This would further dry up the investment activity, or channelling\nof household savings in capital markets that the economy needs for growth.\n\n\n## 196",

Since then, there have been many amendments through various\nregulations and circulars. In all the cases, the objective has always remained to protect\nthe interests of the mutual fund investors, and to empower investors to take informed\ninvestment decisions. For this purpose, the regulations have covered many aspects like\ninvestor services, accounting of NAV and valuation norms, disclosures, investment\nnorms, to name a few.\n\n\n## Some of the important provisions of the regulations are discussed below:\n\n\n## SEBI circular on mutual fund scheme categorization and rationalization aimed towards\nconversion and consolidation of existing schemes and new products. The objective\nwas to reduce the number of schemes to one per category in the open-ended arena,\nso that investors do not get confused. However, that required consolidation through\nmerger of certain schemes with other schemes. The SEBI regulations and circulars\ndetail the procedure of such scheme mergers, as well as the disclosures of\nperformance of such schemes. The circular on scheme categorization and\nrationalization, mandated that there can be only one scheme per category within the\nfund house. Various other provisions such as definition of various categories based on\nmarket capitalization were included to bring-in uniformity.\n\n\n## During the 2018 credit crisis, SEBI laid down the provision for creating segregated\nportfolios for protecting the interests of the unitholders and giving fair treatment to\nall investors in case of a credit event and to deal with liquidity risk.\n\n\n## Presently, in terms Regulation 32 of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 (“MF\nRegulations\") and SEBI Circular no. SEBI/HO/IMD/DF2/CIR/P/2018/160 dated\nDecember 28, 2018, every close-ended scheme and units of segregated portfolio shall\nbe listed on recognized stock exchanges. As per MF Regulations, there are several steps\nenvisaged with respect to winding up of Mutual Fund schemes before the scheme\nceases to exist. During this process, such units can be listed and traded on a recognized\nstock exchange, which may provide an exit to investors.\n\n\n## The units of mutual fund schemes which are in the process of winding-up (due\nto any event which, in the opinion of the trustees, requires the scheme to be wound\nup) then those schemes have to be listed on recognized stock exchange. However,\npursuant to listing, trading on stock exchange mechanism will not be mandatory for\ninvestors, rather, if they so desire, may avail an optional channel to exit provided to\nthem. Initially, trading in units of such a listed scheme that is under the process of\nwinding up, shall be in dematerialised form.\n\n\n## 197",

A Price Return Index considers only the\nprice movement of its constituents and thus captures only the capital gains of the\nconstituents. On the other hand, a Total Returns index takes into account all dividends/\ninterest payments that are generated from the basket of components that make up\nthe index in addition to the capital gains. The cash flows are presumed to be notionally\nreinvested on their ex-date into the basket of underlying components that make up\nthe index. A Mutual Fund scheme takes into consideration, capital gains as well as the\ndividend earnings / interest income of the instruments in which it has invested while\ncalculating the return generated by the scheme. TRI is more appropriate as a\nbenchmark to compare the performance of mutual fund schemes. Therefore, SEBI\nstipulated that all Mutual Fund Schemes be benchmarked against Total Return Indices\nfrom February 01, 2018 onwards\n\n\n## SEBI regulations and circulars also mandate exposure limits for investments by mutual\nfund schemes to ensure that investors get a diversified portfolio and the schemes\nremain true-to-label.\n\n\n## The advertisements, valuation of securities, calculation of NAV – each of these aspects\nare very tightly regulated. Such approach ensures that the Indian mutual fund industry\nremains one of the most regulated and transparent investment options for investors.\n\n\n# 10.1.2 Mutual Funds Regulations\n\n\n# The applicable guidelines for mutual funds are set out in SEBI (Mutual Funds)\nRegulations, 1996, as amended from time to time. Some aspects of these regulations\nare discussed in various sections of this workbook. An updated and comprehensive list\nof circulars issued by SEBI can be found in the Mutual Funds section of SEBI's website:\nwww.sebi.gov.in. Master Circulars, which capture the essence of various circulars\nissued from time to time, may be downloaded from www.sebi.gov.in.57\n\n\n# Wherever applicable, mutual funds need to comply with regulations issued by other\nregulators also. For instance, RBI regulates the money market and foreign exchange\nmarket in the country. Therefore, mutual funds need to comply with RBI's regulations\nregarding investment in the money market, investments outside the country,\n\n57 Candidates are advised to read the SEBI master circular on mutual funds issued from time to time along with other circulars\nissued by SEBI.\n\n\n## 198",

Mutual Funds need to comply with the rules of the\nexchanges with which they choose to have a business relationship i.e. for listing the\nunits of the mutual fund schemes launched by them.\n\n\n## 10.1.3 Investment restrictions and portfolio diversification norms for mutual fund\nschemes\n\n\n## Mutual fund is a managed investment vehicle. It is a pass-through vehicle—in that the\nrisks and the returns are passed on to the unitholders. The investors have no control,\nover the investment management of the mutual fund. It is in this context that SEBI has\nlaid down regulations pertaining to investment universe, restrictions and portfolio\ndiversification for investment by mutual fund schemes. Such regulations intend to\ncontrol the risks taken by the mutual fund managers.\n\n\n# The SEBI Regulations provide for various limits to the kind of investments that are\npossible in mutual fund schemes. In few cases, there are also aggregate limits for all\nschemes of a mutual fund. The regulator's objective behind setting these limits is to\nensure mitigation of risks in the scheme and protecting the investor's interests. The\nrestrictions specified apply at the time of making the investment. Some of the\nimportant restrictions specified are:\n\n- The Mutual Fund will buy and sell securities on delivery basis. Securities\npurchased will be transferred in the name of the Mutual Fund on account of\nthe respective scheme.\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## The Mutual Fund shall not advance any loans.\n\n\n## The scheme will not invest in the unlisted or privately placed securities of any\nassociate or group company of the sponsor.\n\n\n## 10.1.4 SEBI Advertisement Code for Mutual Funds\n\n\n# The important provisions pertaining to SEBI's Advertising Code for mutual\nfunds (MFs) arelisted below:\n\n- Advertisements shall be accurate, true, fair, clear, complete,\nunambiguous and concise.\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Advertisements shall not contain statements that are false, misleading,\nbiased or deceptive, based on assumption/projections and shall not\ncontain any testimonials orany ranking based on any criteria.\n\n\n## 199",
