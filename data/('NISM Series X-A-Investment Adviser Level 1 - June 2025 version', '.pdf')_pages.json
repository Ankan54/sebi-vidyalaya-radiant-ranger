The regular income for a\nhousehold or individual may come from sources such as profession, salary, business or even\ninvestments. The normal activities of a household or individual and the routine expenses are\nwoven around the regular income and the time when this is received. However, there are\nother expenses that may also have to be met out of the available income.\n\n\n## The current income that is received must also provide for a time when there will be no or low\nincome being generated, such as in the retirement period. There may be unexpected\nexpenses which are not budgeted, such as a large medical expense, or there may be needs in\nthe future that require a large sum of money, such as education of children or buying a home,\nall of which require adequate funds to be made available at the right time. A portion of the\ncurrent income is therefore saved and applied to creating assets that will meet these\nrequirements. Financial planning refers to the process of streamlining the income, expenses,\nassets and liabilities of the household or individual to take care of both current and future\nneed for funds.\n\n\n## Example\n\n\n# Vinod is 40 years old and earns Rs.2 lakhs a month. He is able to save about Rs.40,000 a month\nafter meeting all the routine expenses of his family, paying the loans for his house, car and\nother needs. His investments include those for tax savings, bank deposits, bonds and some\nmutual funds. He pays premiums on life insurance for himself and his wife. Vinod is the sole\nearning member of his family and he believes he takes care of his finances adequately to take\ncare of his current and future needs. How would financial planning help him?\n\n\n## The following are a set of indicative issues that financial planning will help Vinod resolve:\n\n\n## 18",

What kinds of investments are suitable for Vinod to\nbuild the required corpus?\n- How much of risk is Vinod willing and able to take with his investments? How would those\nrisks be managed?\n- How should Vinod ensure that his savings and investments are aligned to changes in his\nfuture needs?\n\n\n## income, expenses,\n\n\n## A formal treatment of the issues that Vinod faces will require a financial planning process to\nassess the current situation; identify the current and future needs; determine the savings\nrequired to meet those needs and put the savings to work so that the required funds are\navailable to meet each need as planned.\n\n\n## Financial planning is thus a process that enables better management of the personal financial\nsituation of a household or individual. It works primarily through the identification of key\ngoals and putting in place an action plan to realign the finances to meet those goals. It is a\nholistic approach that considers the existing financial position, evaluates the future needs,\nputs a process to fund the needs and reviews the progress.\n\n\n## 1.2 Understand the need for financial planning\n\n\n## There is a large range of financial products and services that are available for investors today\nand these need to be linked to the specific needs and situations of the client. Not every\nproduct may be suitable to every client; nor would a client be able to identify how to choose\nand use products and services from the choices that are available in the market. Financial\nplanning bridges this gap as the Investment Adviser possesses the expertise to understand\nthe dynamics of the products on the one hand and the needs of the client on the other. This\nmakes them best suited to use such products and services in the interest of the client.\n\n\n## 19",

A financial planner has capabilities to compare, evaluate and\nanalyse various products which enables making efficient choices from competing products.\n- Asset allocation is a technical approach to managing money that requires evaluating asset\nclasses and products for their risk and return features, aligning them to the investor's financial\ngoals, monitoring the current and expected performance of asset classes and modifying the\nweights to each asset in the investor's portfolio periodically to reflect this. Financial planners\nwith technical expertise enable professional management of assets.\n- Financial planning is a dynamic process that requires attention to the constantly changing\nmarket and product performances and matching these with the dynamic changes in the needs\nand status of the client. This kind of attention can be provided by a financial planner.\n\n1.2.2 How is financial planning different from typical financial advisory services?\n\n\n## Financial planning is a specific process that centre's on the client, their needs, and their goals\nOther financial advisory services would normally look at meeting just a specific need like\nadvising on stocks or debt but the relation with other aspects might be missing.\n\n\n## 20\n\n\n## 20\n\n\n<!-- Page 21 -->\n\n\n# The financial planning effort is a comprehensive process as it covers all aspects of a client's\npersonal financial requirements including retirement, insurance, investment, estate and\nothers. A typical financial advisory service is more likely to look at just a small part of the\nclient's total financial requirements.\n\n\n# Goal setting becomes the central part of the financial planning process and all efforts are then\ndirected towards meeting the goals. Overall goals might not be given too much importance\nin a normal financial advisory activity, where some specific target is sought to be achieved.\n\n\n## Financial planning looks to ensure that all the financial activities work together and don't\nconflict. As against this, a typical financial advisory service might not even realise that some\nsteps suggested would be working against some other goal or requirement. For example,\nfinancial planning would ensure that the asset allocation for an older individual meets their\nrisk taking ability and that their equity exposure across asset classes is kept in check. This\nmight not happen when normal advice is taken for example advising on equity mutual funds\ninvestment without knowing the equity exposure elsewhere.\n\n\n## Monitoring the situation and then taking action to ensure that things remain on track is a key\npart of the financial planning process. It is inbuilt to the entire effort, so this becomes a natural\npart of the activity. This might not happen with respect to a normal financial advisory where\nthe individual might have to take the initiative themselves and see that things are going\naccording to plan.\n\n\n## Financial planning looks to select what is right for an individual and this would differ from\nperson to person. This takes into account both the returns as well as the risk which is vital.\nThis might not happen for a normal financial advice, where the goal might be completely\ndifferent like earning higher return and where risk might be ignored.\n\n\n## There has to be continuity in financial planning efforts which sets it apart from other financial\nadvisory wherein this could be a short one-time exercise or even piecemeal efforts at\ndifferent periods of time.\n\n\n## 1.3 Scope of financial planning\n\n\n# Financial planning enables a household or individual to manage its personal finances\nefficiently in line with their short and long-term objectives. The following are elements of\nfinancial advisory and planning services:\n\n\n# 1.3.1 Personal financial analysis:\n\n\n## Goal setting with prioritizing of goals\n\n\n## 21",
    "page_number": 19

  {
    "page_content": "<!-- Page 22 -->\n\n\n# The financial planning process starts with the goal setting process. Goals refer to what has to\nbe achieved. This gives a clear target that has to be reached. There are several features that\nare important when the goals are set. There should be some specific detail with respect to\nthe goal. For example, saying that I want to be rich is a vague term because it can mean\ndifferent things to different people. Saying that I want to earn an income of Rs. 50 lakh a year\nis specific. The goals have to be measurable, so that a person knows the exact amount that\nwill help them reach the goal. At the same time the goals have to be realistic. If an individual\nis able to save around Rs 20,000 a month, then a goal which requires an investment of Rs\n50,000 a month is not realistic. Finally, goals also have to be time bound so the individual has\na clear idea of when they need to be reached. A goal of wanting to retire in 20 years with Rs\n5 crore as corpus is clear because there is a time period attached to it which will help in\nplanning to reach the goal.\n\n\n## Once all these features are considered in the goal setting process there will be a list of goals\nthat will be available. However, every individual has restrictions in terms of the income earned\nand amount saved. This will require that the goals be ranked in order of priority. Important\ngoals need to be put first. So, things like children's education and retirement should come in\nfront of something like spending on a luxury car or other expense that does not create an\nasset. It is easy to look at short term needs but this can come at the cost of long term\ndisruption of the goals. This is why there has to be priority to goals that improve the financial\nhealth of the individual. For example, there might be a large credit card outstanding and some\nextra income is earned by the individual. In such a situation, instead of spending the amount,\nit should be used to pay off the credit card debt. This might not add to an asset but it still\nimproves the financial condition of the individual.\n\n- Focus on important goals\n\n\n## Goals such as retirement and education of children are important financial goals for which\nadequate provision of funds have to be made. Long-term goals such as retirement often get\nlower priority for allocation of savings because it has time on its side. The urgent, shorter-\nterm goals often get higher claim on the available savings. While this may be acceptable for\nshorter-term goals that are also important, such as accumulating funds for down payment on\na home, it may not be right to prioritize consumption goals, such as holidays and large\npurchases, over long-term important goals. The delay in saving for such goals will affect the\nfinal corpus, since it loses the longer saving and earning benefits including that of\ncompounding.\n\n\n## Clients often believe that the provident fund, superannuation and gratuity corpus they will\nreceive on retirement will be adequate to ensure a comfortable living during the retirement\nyears. In many cases, it turns out to be inadequate. Therefore, every client needs a retirement\nplan.\n\n\n## 22\n\n\n## 22",

There are situations when it is not possible to achieve a financial goal in a\nspecific time period. An example could be a person wanting to buy a house within the next\nyear, which would require a down payment of Rs 20 lakh plus an Equated Monthly Instalment\n(EMI) of Rs 30,000 a month. It could be that the current income situation is not able to support\nsuch a situation. Instead of cancelling the goal there is another route available. This is to push\nback the goal by some time, which will enable the individual to get the required finances in\norder. Instead of 1 year, if the goal is sought to be achieved after 3 years, then there is a good\nchance that the desired financial position will be achieved by then.\n\n\n## For instance, around the time that the family proposes to buy a house, the annual holiday\nmay need to be reviewed. The holiday may be shorter or planned at a less expensive location.\nSome financial goals need to be fulfilled within a specified time frame. For instance, education\nof the child has to happen as per the normal age and progression. Prudent use of debt in the\nform of loans can be used to tide over any shortage of funds. The figure below helps an\nindividual in visualising the parameters for setting personal goals.\n\n\n## S\n\n\n## M\n\n\n## R\n\n\n## T\n\nSpecific: State exactly what you want to accomplish (Who,\nWhat, Where, Why)\n\n- Measurable: How will you demonstrate and evaluate the\nextent to which the goal has been met?\n\nAchievable: stretch and challenging goals within ability to\nachieve outcome. What is the action-oriented verb?\n\nRelevant: How does the goal tie into your key responsibilities?\nHow is it aligned to objectives?\n\n\n## Time-bound: Set 1 or more target dates, the \"by when\" to\nguide your goal to successful and timely completion (include\ndeadlines, dates and frequency)\n\n\n## 1.3.2 Cash flow management and budgeting\n\n\n# There is a certain income that is earned by an individual along with the expenses made.\nHaving a plan to ensure that there are savings and these are invested is one part of the\nprocess. It is also vital that there is a cash flow match so that the household or the individual\n\n\n## 23",

  {
    "page_content": "<!-- Page 24 -->\n\n\n# does not run into any cash flow problems. This happens when the inflows and outflows of\ncash do not match. There can be a situation wherein a person spends less than what they\nearn but still run into cash flow problems. For example, if there is a large expense made at\nthe start of a month it can lead to a cash crunch if there is a delay in the receipt of income\nunless there is a reserve present. In fact, it could lead to short term borrowings which are\nextremely costly in terms of interest rates. This could lead to a part of the amount that is\nbeing finally saved to be directed towards paying off the debt incurred due to the cash flow\nmismatch.\n\n\n## One of the ways to ensure that there is no cash flow problem is to have a budget with cash\nflow dates. A budget is nothing but a list of the inflows and outflows that an individual will\nwitness along with the time period when this will take place. A monthly budget will help a\nperson to know whether they are managing their income properly. A budget has a list of all\nthe items of income and expenses along with their amounts. This ensures that with a single\nlook it is possible to know what the exact financial position is and whether there is adequate\nsavings taking place. Every person should make their own personal budget. A lot of people\npay attention to the Union Budget but fail to do budgeting for their ownselves.\n\n\n# 1.3.3 Insurance Planning\n\n\n## Several unexpected expenses that can cause an imbalance in the income and expenses of a\nhousehold can be managed with insurance. Insurance is a risk transfer mechanism where a\nsmall premium payment can result in payments from the insurance company to tide over risks\nfrom unexpected events. The temporary loss of income from disabilities and permanent loss\nof income from death can be covered with life insurance products. Health and accident\ninsurance covers help in dealing with unexpected events that can impair the income of a\nhousehold, while increasing its expenses on health care and recuperation. General insurance\ncan provide covers for loss and damage to property and other valuables from fire, theft and\nsuch events. Insurance planning involves estimating the losses to the household from\nunexpected events and choosing the right products and amounts to cover such losses.\n\n\n## 1.3.4 Debt management and counselling\n\n\n## Investment Advisers help households plan their liabilities efficiently. It is common for\nhouseholds to borrow in order to fund their homes, cars and durables. Several households\nalso use credit cards extensively. To borrow is to use tomorrow's income today. A portion of\nthe future income has to be apportioned to repay the borrowings. This impacts the ability to\nsave in future and in extreme cases can stress the ability to spend on essentials too. The asset\nbeing funded by borrowing may be an appreciating asset such as property, which is also\ncapable of generating rental income. Or the loan could be funding a depreciating asset such\nas a car, which may require additional expenses on fuel and maintenance, but provide better\nlifestyle and commuting conveniences.\n\n\n## 24\n\n\n## 22",

    "page_content": "<!-- Page 25 -->\n\n\n# Evaluating which assets or expenses can be funded by borrowings is a function Investment\nAdvisers can perform. They can advise households about how to finance their assets, how\nmuch to borrow, how to provide for repayment, how to ensure that credit scores are not\nunfavourably impacted. Sometimes, excessive borrowings may lead a household into a debt\ntrap. Such borrowers need counselling and handholding to be able to get out of debt.\nSometimes assets may have to be liquidated to pay off debts. Advisers help households to\ndeal with their borrowings taking into account their need and ability to repay debt.\n\n\n## 1.3.5 Investment Planning and Asset Allocation\n\n\n## A crucial component in financial planning and advisory is the funding of financial goals of a\nhousehold. Investment planning involves estimating the ability of the household to save and\nchoosing the right assets in which such saving should be invested. Investment planning\nconsiders the purpose, or financial goals for which money is being put aside. These goals can\nbe short-term such as buying a car, taking a holiday, buying a gift, or funding a family\nceremony or can be long-term such as education for the children, retirement for the income\nearners, or high-expense goals such as marriage of children. An Investment Adviser helps with\na plan to save for these goals, and suggests an appropriate asset allocation to pursue.\nThe Investment Adviser does not focus on the selection of stocks or bonds, but instead takes\na top-down approach of asset allocation. The focus is on how much money is invested in\nwhich particular asset class in order to deliver the expected return within the risk preference\nof the investor. The adviser's job is to construct a portfolio of asset classes, taking into account\nthe goals, the savings, the required return, and the risk-taking ability of the investor. This is\none of the core functions of the adviser and many specialise in asset allocation and\ninvestment planning.\n\n\n# 1.3.6 Tax Planning\n\n\n## Income is subject to tax and the amount an individual can save, the return they earn on their\ninvestment and therefore the corpus they are able to build for their future goals, are all\nimpacted by the tax regime they fall under. An investment adviser should be able to assess\nthe impact of taxes on the finances of the individual and advice appropriate saving and\ninvestment options. The post-tax return of financial products will have to be considered while\nchoosing products and estimating holding periods. The taxability of various types of\ninvestment income such as dividends, rents and interest differ. The treatment of return if\naccumulated, rather than paid out periodically, varies. The taxability of gains differs based on\nthe holding period. An investment adviser should bring in these aspects while constructing a\nplan for the household. To be noted, tax efficiency should not be the basis of investment\ndecisions, it is more about guidance and awareness. The basis should be the requirements\nand risk appetite.\n\n\n## 25",

To be able to\nplan for retirement it is important to understand the concept of time value of money and\ninflation and how it would impact the cost of meeting expenses in the future. Saving and\ninvesting for retirement requires understanding of how compounding benefits investors\nsaving for long-term goals. It is important to select the right financial products that are best\nsuited to the long-term nature of the retirement goal as well as to the ability of the individual\nto take risks. In the pre-retirement stage, rebalancing the portfolio to less volatile assets is an\nimportant activity. As retirement approaches, the process of planning should shift focus to\nthe expenses in retirement, the adequacy of the income from investments and pension\nbenefits to meet these expenses and strategies to meet the shortfall, if any. While investing\nthe retirement corpus for income, the taxability of different sources should be considered.\nThe retirement portfolio has to be monitored and rebalanced through the term of retirement\ntoo since the needs do not remain the same. Investment Advisers bring the skills required to\ndesign and execute a retirement plan.\n\n\n# 1.3.8 Estate Planning\n\n\n## Wealth is passed on across generations. This process of inter-generational transfer not only\ninvolves legal aspects with respect to entitlements under personal law, but also\ndocumentation and processes that will enable a smooth transition of wealth in a tax-efficient\nway. Estate planning refers to all those activities that are focused on transfer of wealth to\nheirs, charity, and other identified beneficiaries. There are several tools and structures to\nchoose from, in estate planning. Some choices such as gifts can be exercised during one's\nlifetime, while choices such as wills come into play after death. Investment Advisers help\nhouseholds make these choices after considering all the implications, and help them\ncomplete the legal and documentation processes efficiently.\n\n\n## 1.4 Concept of asset, liabilities and net worth\n\n\n## The income of a household or individual is at the base of all financial activities that are\nundertaken. The income is used to meet current expenses and a portion is set aside to meet\nexpenses in the future. The portion of current income earmarked for future needs is called\nsavings. The adequacy of the income of a household or individual is always relative to its\nexpenses. If the expenses are managed within the income and there is surplus to save, then\nthe household's or individual's finances are seen as stable. Short-term imbalances in income\nand expenses can be managed by loans and advances. The loans are a liability and come at a\ncost which may further strain the future income. The option of loans to fund expenses must\nbe used with discretion since it weakens the financial situation of the household.\n\n\n## 26",

Assets\nare broadly classified as physical assets and financial assets. Assets may be appreciating in\nvalue or depreciating. All assets have a resale value. Investors hold assets for the returns they\nprovide. The nature of return that an asset provides classifies them as growth-oriented,\nincome-oriented or a combination of the two.\n\n\n## Physical assets are tangible assets and include real estate, gold and other precious metals.\nPhysical assets have an intrinsic value though the actual price at which they trade is impacted\nby demand and supply. They are usually seen as natural hedges against inflation since their\nprice show a positive correlation with inflation. Physical assets are more growth investments\nthat are bought for the appreciation in value rather than the income they generate. Some\nsuch as real estate provide both income and growth while others such as gold are pure\ngrowth-oriented assets. The primary drawbacks of physical assets are illiquidity, lack of\nregulation/limited regulation and the need for specific skills to identify investment\nopportunities, assess the merits of the investment, arrange for the purchase of the asset and\nits management and sale of the asset when required. The other limitation of physical assets\nas an investment is that they are typically large ticket investments and require substantial\nsavings or a combination of savings and loan to acquire. When it comes to investment in\nphysical assets, the adviser has to guide the investor, not to confuse consumption assets like\ncar with physical investments, though the life a particular physical asset may be relatively long\nthan other such assets.\n\n\n## Financial assets represent a claim that the investor has on benefits represented by the asset.\nFor example, a bank deposit gives the benefit of periodic interest and repayment of principal\namount to the holder of the asset, an equity share provides periodic dividend paid, if any, and\nthe appreciation or depreciation in its value is also to the account of the holder. These assets\nmay be structured as growth-oriented assets, such as equity investments, or as income-\noriented, such as deposits, or a combination of the two, such as all listed securities. Financial\nassets are typically standardized products and controlled by the regulations in force at the\npoint in time. They may differ on liquidity features, with some such as listed securities\nenjoying high liquidity, while others such as privately placed instruments featuring low\nliquidity. The standardization of financial assets and the mandatory information made\navailable makes evaluation and comparisons more efficient. These assets lend themselves to\ninvestment in small amounts and units.\n\n\n# Together, the income / growth oriented physical and financial assets represent the\ninvestments made by the investor. While these assets represent financial benefits and returns\nto the holder, the financial strength of the household depends upon how the assets are\nacquired. Loans and borrowings used to buy assets create a liability and impose a repayment\nobligation on the buyer and a charge on the future income of the household. Loans taken to\nbuy appreciating assets add to the long-term wealth. Loans taken to buy financial assets, also\n\n\n## 27",

Assets\nacquired with savings and without taking on a liability add to the financial strength of the\nhousehold.\n\n\n# An assessment of the financial well-being of the household can be made by calculating the\nNet-worth. The net-worth is calculated as Assets - Liabilities. Higher this number better is the\nfinancial position of the household. Net-worth should be calculated periodically, and the\nprogress tracked to bring the financial situation to the desired stage.\n\n\n## 1.5 Financial Planning process\n\n\n## Financial planning requires Investment Advisers to follow a process that enables acquiring\nclient data and working with the client to arrive at appropriate financial decisions and plans,\nwithin the context of the defined relationship between the planner and the client. The\nfollowing is the six-step process that is used in the practice of financial planning.\n\n- Establish and define the client-planner relationship: The planning process begins when\nthe client engages an Investment Adviser and describes the scope of work to be done and\nthe terms on which it would be done.\n- Gather client data, including goals: The future needs of a client require clear definition in\nterms of how much money will be needed and when. This is the process of defining a\nfinancial goal.\n- Analyse and evaluate financial status: The current financial position of a client needs to\nbe understood to make an assessment of income, expenses, assets and liabilities. The\nability to save for a goal and choose appropriate investment vehicles depends on the\ncurrent financial status.\n- Develop and present financial planning recommendations: The adviser makes an\nassessment of what is already there, and what is needed in the future and recommends a\nplan of action. This may include augmenting income, controlling expenses, reallocating\nassets, managing liabilities and following a saving and investment plan for the future.\ne. Implement the financial planning recommendations: This involves executing the plan\nand completing the necessary procedure and paperwork for implementing the decisions\ntaken with the client.\n- Monitor the financial planning recommendations: The financial situation of a client can\nchange over time and the performance of the chosen investments may require review.\nAn adviser monitors the plan to ensure it remains aligned to the goals and is working as\nplanned and makes revisions as may be required.\n\n\n## 28",

In several\ncountries, including India, there has been regulatory action in defining the role of various\nintermediaries that deal with investors. When a relationship manager, financial adviser,\nwealth manager or other entity, irrespective of the nomenclature used, sells financial\nproducts to a client as part of his defined role or business, and earns a commission from the\nproducer of the financial product, there is a potential conflict of interest. The seller of the\nproduct may not act in the interest of the client, but may push products that earn a higher\ncommission. This may lead to mis-selling, where a product not suitable to the client's needs,\nor not in line with the client's risk preference may be sold in a manner harmful to the\ncustomer's interest.\n\n\n## One of the regulatory initiatives to prevent such mis-selling is to differentiate between\nproviders of advice and distributors of financial products, and to ask advisers to earn their\nrevenue from the client, and not from the producer. The distributor who executes the\ntransactions in financial products may earn a commission from the producer. The current\nregulatory regime for financial advisers in India requires that anyone offering financial advice\nfor a consideration should be registered with SEBI, and should not earn any income from the\nproducer. There are specific exemptions provided for those that offer advice incidental to a\nproduct they may sell.\n\n\n## The following are the various business models in the delivery of financial advice to clients:\n\n- Fee-only financial planners and advisers: Some Investment Advisers choose to earn a\nprimary component of their income from enabling clients to plan their finances in a\ncomprehensive manner. They engage closely with the client, offer advice on most if not\nall aspects of their personal finance, and charge a fee for their services. The fee may be of\nvarious types and a combination of the following:\n- One-time fee for a financial plan\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Fee for on-going review and periodic revisions\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Asset-based fee charged as a percentage of assets being advised\n\n\n## ·\n\nReferral fee for engaging experts to take care of specific aspects of the plan\n\n- Referral fee for execution of plan through other agencies\n\n\n## Selection and portfolio construction fees\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Fees for assessment and analysis of financial position\n\n\n## Fee only Investment Advisers usually do not take on the execution of the plan or advice. They\nrefer the client to other agencies who may enable execution of the recommended investment\n\n\n## 29",

This is to ensure that the commissions earned on selling financial products, does\nnot influence their advice to their clients.\n\n\n# Under the amendments to the Investment Adviser Regulations, SEBI has said that individual\nInvestment advisers cannot undertake both advisory and distribution. They have the choice\nto register as either of the two. A non-individual investment adviser will have client level\nsegregation at the group level for these services. It also has to maintain an arm's length\nrelationship by providing the advisory services through a separate division or department.\n\n\n## Individual Investment advisers are allowed to provide execution services but through direct\nschemes or products in the securities market. However, no consideration can be received at\nthe investment advisers group or family level for these services.\n\n- Execution only services: Some Investment Advisers do not charge their clients for advice\nas their core function is distributing financial products. Their income comes from the\ncommissions from selling the product. They may also execute transactions advised by\nanother financial adviser. Such advisers may also distribute a range of products including\ninvestment products, insurance products, banking and loan products, which are subject\nto regulations by multiple regulators apart from SEBI.\n\n\n## Some firms may organise the execution only services into an aggregation model. The\naggregating entity has several distributors associated with it, who take a range of financial\nproducts to clients. In this case, the company shortlists the products it would offer, based\non its selection criteria. It may also have a central advisory team that selects products\nafter research and data analysis. Those that like to offer these products to their clients,\nmay associate with such company, and share their revenue with the company for using\ntheir research services, or execution platforms. Many aggregators offer a range of support\nservices to their associates, including training, development, customer relationship\nmanagement software, execution platforms and facilities that may be expensive to set up\non a standalone basis. The shared facility helps the distributors to scale up their business,\nand pay the aggregator a share of revenue for the benefits offered.\n\n- Wraps and Platforms: Wraps and platforms are technology-based advisory solutions that\nare standardised for execution. A client or an adviser associate with the platform, offers\nits financial products as model portfolios that investors can buy. Investment Advisers may\nalso choose these platforms to execute transactions in standardised model portfolios.\nClients can view how their portfolios are performing. Advisers can monitor and review the\nportfolios and holistically manage the money of clients across multiple products. Wraps\nand platforms may charge the client a fee and share this fee with the adviser who executes\nthe transactions using it. They may also enable the adviser to access clients using their\nplatforms, to sell financial advice to such clients, and charge a fee and share it with the\nplatform provider.\n\n\n## 30\n\n\n<!-- Page 31 -->\n\n\n# CHAPTER 2: TIME VALUE OF MONEY\n\n\n# LEARNING OBJECTIVES:\n\n\n# After studying this chapter, you should know about:\n\n\n## ☑\n\n\n# Time Value of Money\n\n\n# Concept of Annuity\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Concept of Perpetuity\n\n\n## 2.1 Time Value of Money\n\n\n# The value of money does not remain the same at all points of time. The money available at\nthe present time is worth more than the same amount in the future since it has the potential\nto earn returns (or interest as the case may be). Consider the following options, assuming\nthere is no uncertainty associated with the cash flow:\n\n- Receiving Rs.100 now\n- Receiving Rs.100 after one month\n\n\n## All investors would prefer to receive the cash flow now, rather than wait for a month, though\nthe amount to be received has the same value. This preference is attributed to the following\n\n\n## reasons:\n\n\n## ☑ Instinctive preference for current consumption over future consumption.\n\n- Ability to invest the Rs.100 for a month like a bank account or deposit and earn a\nreturn so that it grows in value to more than Rs. 100 after one month.\n\n\n## Clearly, Rs.100 available now is not equivalent to Rs.100 received after a month. The value\nassociated with the same sum of money received at various points on the timeline is called\nthe time value of money (popularly known as TVM). The time value of money received in\nearlier periods as compared to that received in later time periods will be higher. Since most\ndecisions in finance involve cash flows spread over more than one period (monthly, quarterly,\nyearly etc.) the time value of money is a key principle in financial decision-making.\n\n\n## 31",

The time\nvalue of any loaned item was perhaps easiest to see with the loaning of seeds because any successfully\nplanted seed would yield a plant that would produce more additional seeds. Thus, it was wise to get\nseeds in the ground, both to yield a healthy crop and to have more seeds for future plantings.*\n\n\n## Since money has time value, it is not possible to compare cash flows received in different time periods.\nConsider the above example: suppose the Rs.100 received now is placed in a one-month bank deposit\nyielding 6% p.a. After a month, the value would grow to Rs.100.50. If an investor has to opt for receiving\nRs.100 after a month, then he needs to be compensated by Rs.0.50, the amount that has been foregone\nby waiting for a month. The two options will be equivalent from the investor's point of view if the option\nis to receive Rs.100 now or Rs.100.50 after one month.\n\n\n## When time values are taken into account, the following points need to be noted:\n\nFuture inflows are discounted by a relevant rate to reach their present value; this rate is known\nas the discount rate or return rate or interest rate.\n\nPresent inflows are increased at a relevant rate to reach their future values: this rate is known\nas the compound interest rate.\n\n\n## The later in the future a cash flow is likely to be received, the lower its value at the current time.\nRs.100 available after one month is more valuable today than Rs.100 available after one year, which has\na better value today than Rs.100 available after 5 years.\n\n\n## The higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of future cash flows. A higher rate\nmeans that investors have to forego more returns by opting to receive the money today instead of future\ncash flows.\n\nFor example, Rs 1,000 received after 3 years when discounted at 5 per cent is worth Rs 864 today but\nthe same amount discount at 8 per cent is worth only Rs 794.\n\n\n# In any time, value situation, the important parameters are:\n\n\n## a.\n\nCash inflows or outflows: These could be either in the form of single period cash flow or in the\nform of an annuity or a stream of uneven or even cash flows.\n\n\n## b.\n\n\n## C.\n\n\n## d.\n\n\n## Rate of interest: Also known as compounding rate or discount rate or reinvestment rate.\nTime Period: This may be annual or any other fraction thereof like monthly, quarterly etc.\nFrequency of cash flows, which may or may not be fixed.\n\n\n## Financial problems involving time value of money are usually concerned with calculating one of the\nabove parameters.\n\n*(https://www.encyclopedia.com/finance/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/time-value-\n\n\n## money)\n\n\n## 32",

Consider this example:\n\n\n## An investor purchased mutual fund units at an NAV of Rs.11. After 450 days, she redeemed it\nat Rs.13.50. What is her compounded rate of return, assume that it's a non-leap year?\n\n\n## In order to use the CAGR formula, period of 450 days has to be converted into years or\n450/365\n\n\n## years.\n\n\n## CAGR=((13.5/11)^{\\wedge}(365/450))-1\n\n\n## =0.1807=18.07\\%\n\n\n## 38",

It is essential to know the amount\nthat would be paid, so that there can be a proper planning made of how the amount should\n\n\n## be accumulated.\n\nThis can be obtained using Excel using the PMT formula where the inputs will be the following\n\n\n## r= the rate of interest on the loan\n\nNper = the number of periods for which the loan has to be repaid\n\nPV= the value of the loan that has to be repaid\n\nThe figure that emerges will be the EMI that will have to be paid.\n\n\n# For example, Satish is thinking of taking a loan of Rs 30 lakh for the purchase of a house\nproperty in his hometown. The current rate of interest is 6.5 per cent with a monthly reset\nand he is looking for a 20 year loan. What would be his monthly EMI?\n\n\n## In this case, all the relevant details are available. One thing to take care of is that the interest\nrate would have to be divided by 12 because the period for this is monthly. At the same time\nthe period of payment is monthly so this would become 240 months.\n\n\n## Entering the figures into the formula it will be\n\nPMT=(0.065/12,240,-3000000) type is 0 assuming EMI is payable at the end of the month\n\n\n## PMT=22367.19\n\n\n## The final EMI figure that would have to be paid comes to around Rs 22,367. This kind of\ncalculation can be done, so that the client is able to know whether the amount is affordable\n\n\n## for them. Also, any change in the interest rate can also be applied to witness the kind of\nimpact that is seen in the monthly payments and the change therein.\n\n\n## For example, in the above case if the interest rate falls to 6.25 per cent then what will be the\nEMI for the 20 year loan. In this case\n\n\n## PMT=(0.0625/12,240.-3000000)\n\n\n## PMT=21927.85\n\n\n## 39",

Changes at any point of time during the loan period can be seen\nthrough this calculation.\n\n\n# 2.2.5 Period of the loan (NPER)\n\n\n# There are times when a person would like to know the time period within which they would\nbe able to pay off an amount. Given the fact that there is a capital amount that is present\nalong with the loan interest and a fixed amount repaid each month the amount in which the\nloan can be repaid can be known. This is also known by its Excel term NPER.\n\n\n## The details that are vital here is the\n\n\n## r = rate of interest on the loan\n\n\n## PMT = the equal payment on the loan\n\n\n## PV = The present value of all the future payments\n\n\n## For example, a person wants to know the NPER of a loan that is worth Rs 5 lakh now and\nwhere the EMI is Rs 12,000 per month. The rate of interest on the loan is 8 per cent.\n\n\n## In this case too since this is a monthly payment the interest rate would have to be divided by\n12 and putting this into the Excel formula we get =NPER(0.08/12,-12000,500000).\n\n\n## = 48.97\n\n\n## The result is 48.97 months. This gives a clear idea about the time period in which the payment\nwould be complete.\n\n\n## The NPER is useful to calculate the time period of repayment and this is then matched with\nthe EMI payable, so that it can be affordable for the individual.\n\n\n## 2.2.6 Annuity\n\n\n## An annuity is a sum of money paid at regular periods, such as monthly, quarterly, annually.\nA common example of an annuity is pension. Annuities can be of two types (1) Fixed annuity\nand (2) Flexible annuity.\n\n\n## Fixed Annuity means that fixed returns are received at regular periods. For instance, a fixed\ndeposit with a bank paying 5.5 % p.a. on the investment for a predetermined term assured\n(for example, for the next 5 years).\n\n\n## 40\n\n\n<!-- Page 41 -->\n\n\n# Floating annuities are those in which the returns are benchmarked to inflation or index\nreturns or any other return as specified in the indenture agreement at the time of buying. So,\nthe annuities paid are not fixed, but change in line with the chosen benchmark.\n\n\n# Annuities are used extensively during retirement wherein there is the need for a regular cash\nflow and this is generated by several investment instruments. There are various terms by\nwhich an annuity is referred to but the key point is that the feature of all these are that there\nis a regular sum of money being received.\n\n\n## There are two types of annuities that can be received on an investment:\n\n\n## Ordinary Annuity\n\n\n## An annuity is differentiated based on the time period when the payment on it is made. In case\nof an ordinary annuity the payment is made at the end of the relevant time period. Most of\nthe annuities are of this type as the payment comes at the end of the period. Consider for\nexample a bond, which pays out a sum of money. This is received at the end of the year if the\npayment is made annually and this becomes an ordinary annuity.\n\n\n# The way to calculate an annuity is to look at the present value of such a cash flow. This will\ntell you what the future payments are worth at the present time. This can also be used to\nmake various calculations in terms of how much is required in order to ensure a certain\n\n\n## payment in the future.\n\nThe calculation for an ordinary annuity can be done as a normal present value formula.\n\n\n## For example, consider an annuity that is paid out each year of Rs 5,000 and this is at a rate of\nreturn of 10 per cent for a period of 4 years. In this case the present value of the annuity\n\n\n## would come out to\n\n\n## PV=PV(0.1,4,-5000) type 0, assuming end of the year\n\n\n## PV=15849.33\n\n\n## When the PV calculation is made in excel there is a row for details to be entered called type\npresent in the formula. This is usually left blank and it takes the default position of the\n\n\n## payment coming at the end of the period.\n\n\n## There can also be the use of an annuity table for the purpose of the calculation. An annuity\ntable gives a multiple for different rates of interest and varying time periods. One can just\nlook up the annuity table figure and then use this in the calculation.\n\n\n# For example, consider a person who wants to value an annuity of Rs 12,000 a year for 10 years\nat 5 per cent per annum. The normal PV calculation will give the answer as:\n\n\n## 41",

Here the payment is made at\nthe start of the period instead of at the end of the period. This will impact the value of the\nannuity because if you are a person receiving the payment then you are getting it at the start\nof the year which gives the chance for this to be deployed during the year.\n\n\n## In order to get the value of such an annuity the present value of the cash flow would need to\nbe calculated. As compared to an ordinary annuity there is an additional figure that will come\n\n\n## in the calculation.\n\n\n## The calculation for an ordinary annuity can be done using the PV function but here in the type\ncolumn instead of leaving it blank or 0, the number 1 is entered.\n\n\n# For example, consider an annuity that is paid out each year of Rs 5,000 and this is at a rate of\nreturn of 10 per cent for a period of 4 years. This is the same case that was considered in the\nordinary annuity working but here if the payment is made at the start of the year as is the\n\n\n## case with an annuity due then the calculation will become\n\n\n## PV=PV(0.1,4,-5000,,1)\n\n\n## PV=17434.26\n\n\n# As can be seen from above, the payment at the start of the period raises the value of the\nannuity. One has to consider this from various angles. It is more valuable for a person to\nreceive an annuity due because they get the money earlier which can be invested to earn\nfurther return. For someone who has to make payments for any purpose at the start of the\nperiod then this is more costly because they are losing the opportunity of earning on that\nparticular capital for the duration of the year for which the amount would have otherwise\n\n\n## remained with them.\n\n\n## 2.2.7 Perpetuity\n\n\n## 42",

One of the key aspects of the entire process is to look at the cash\nflow that is generated by the individual or household and how this is handled.\n\n\n## There are several factors that make the entire process of managing the cash flow very\nsignificant in the personal finance management process.\n\n\n## The cash flow is the starting point of the whole personal finance process. The time and the\namount of income that is generated and the time and the amount when this is spent as\nexpense is critical to ensure that there is a proper balance maintained between the two.\n\n\n## The time of the cash flow becomes critical because the income has to be available when\nexpenses crop up. A very good example of a balance between income and expense is that of\na salaried individual who gets a monthly income in the form of salary and whose expenses are\nalso due monthly like payment of electricity, telephone bill, salary to household staff etc.\n\n\n## Even a slight mismatch between the cash flow can lead to the need for debt which is costly\nfor the individual. If there is a situation wherein the income comes in at unspecified time\nintervals, but the expenses are evenly spread out then this can lead to a short term mismatch.\nThis has to be met through debt, which comes at a cost in the form of interest. The interest\nbecomes an extra outgo, which reduces the savings further.\n\n\n## There has to be adequate income coming in at all points of time so that a surplus is generated.\nThis surplus called savings is essential because this is necessary for difficult times.

This can\ndisrupt normal life and peace in the family which becomes a crucial factor to consider. This\ncan further lead to health problems if the tension persist over a period of time.\n\n\n# Cash flow management ensures that there is a control over the finances in a family and for an\nindividual. There is a sense of empowerment that this gives, because there is confidence that\nthings are being handled in a proper manner. It also makes for smooth running of the\nhousehold as funds are available as and when required.\n\n\n# 3.2 Preparing Household Budget\n\n\n## The investment adviser performs an important role in helping the household or an individual\nunderstand a household budget. Preparing a household budget entails an understanding of\nthe sources from which the household or individual receives income, and the application of\nthese funds in a typical month. A sample household budget is shown in Table 3.1.\n\n\n## The way to go about preparing a household budget is to first start with the various heads of\nincome. All the amount that is received from various sources has to be listed out and this will\nbecome the income. Some of it might be regular in nature while there might be heads like\ninvestment income that is not regular and which comes infrequently.\n\n\n## On the expense side there are some amounts that have to be compulsorily spent and these\nare called mandatory expenses. Others are essential living expenses, which are necessary for\ndaily use. Finally comes the discretionary expenses and these are the expenses that can be\ncut in case there is need for a control on the total amount spent.\n\n\n## The total expenses when reduced from the total income would give the savings that are\nmanaged by the household. In some cases there could be just a single family member who is\nearning while in other families there could be more than one earning family member.\n\n\n## The difference between monthly surplus in hand and savings is to be noted. The monthly\nsurplus in hand is calculated after mandatory deductions, such as, contributions made to\nprovident fund and National Pension System. These are added back to the monthly surplus in\nhand to arrive at the savings.\n\n\n## Let us assume that 6 months expenses need to be covered. Monthly expenses to consider are\nRs.79,000 (regular expenses) and Rs.12,000 (loan servicing) i.e. Rs.91,000.\n\n\n## 45\n\n\n## 15",

On paper there could be a situation wherein there is some savings or surplus that\nis being seen, but this has to match with the actual cash flow because the income and expense\nfigures have to be backed by actual cash.\n\n\n## This aspect of handling the income and expense flow, so that there is proper balance between\nthe need and availability of cash is known as cash management. For example, consider a\nsituation wherein Sunita earns Rs 50,000 a month. This is the income and the various\nexpenses will be considered against this to see how the savings work out. In reality there is\nsomething more that needs to be seen and this is whether the full amount of Rs 50,000 has\nbeen received every month. It could be that there are several components to Sunita's salary,\nlet us say, Rs 15,000 of various reimbursements that need to be claimed. If in a particular\nmonth this figure has not been claimed, then the actual cash inflow would be just Rs 35,000.\nThis can throw the entire calculation out of control and there could be a cash crunch that\ncould arise.\n\n\n## On the expense side too there has to be look at the cash aspect because this can cause some\nmismatch too. If too many expenses come right at the start of the month then the overall\ncash balance could run low, which would leave less amounts available for spends during the\nrest of the month. In case there is a situation where some additional expenses spring up, then\nagain there could be cash mismatch that is witnessed.\n\n\n## Too many expenses right in the first few days of the month can also lead to a problem if the\nincome is delayed for even a few days. This is where the entire cash management comes into\nplay. Taking all these factors and possibilities into consideration, the individual and the\nhousehold has to ensure that there is enough cash available for various expenses. In addition,\nthere is also the need to ensure that some delays or disruption would not lead to a crisis.\n\n\n## The way in which this would work out is that a surplus amount would always be maintained\nin the bank or in cash. This would ensure that there is adequate balance available for even\nsome extra expenses that might suddenly arise. The other way to tackle this is through the\ncreation of a separate fund set aside for this purpose. This is different from an emergency\nfund that is used to tackle income disruption. This separate fund just helps to tackle some\nshort-term cash mismatch.\n\n\n## Effective cash management is thus at the heart of every budget because this will ensure that\nthere is no crisis that arises because there is not enough money to meet the expenses when\n\n\n## 47",

It takes some understanding of the exact nature of the income and the expenses to\nbe able to create the right cash handling position.\n\n\n# 3.3.2 Income and expenditure statement\n\n\n# An income and expenditure statement gives a view of the financial flows for an individual or\nhousehold for a specific time period. There is always a time period for which the income and\nexpenditure statement is prepared and this could be a year or month.\n\n\n## The income and expenditure statement shows the actual amount of income earned during\nthe period and the actual amount of expenses that have been made. This is a very useful tool\nbecause the actual figures can be compared with the amounts that have been taken in the\nbudget.\n\n\n## All the income that has been earned is taken on one side and this is considered against the\nexpenses that have been incurred. There is a slight difference between the income and the\nexpenditure statement as compared to the cash statement because there can be some items\nin the income and expenditure statement that have not been received or paid yet.\n\n\n## A very good example of this is say income from salary. An individual might be receiving their\nsalary on the first of the next month. However, the income and expenditure figure would\ninclude the figure in the previous month since this pertains to the previous month. The\namount is received a day later, but for calculation purpose it goes into the earlier time period.\nSimilarly, there can be expenses made using a credit card but the payment for this could be\ndue later when the free credit period is over and the bill is generated. Still, this would have to\nbe included in expenditure statement for the period in which the expense was actually made.\n\n\n## The income and expenditure statement shows the extent of the surplus or savings that is\ngenerated and this can also give an idea about where the money is actually going and what\nneeds effective control.\n\n\n## 3.4 Budgeting and forecasting\n\n\n## The income of a household or individual has to be adequate to meet the current expenses as\nwell as provide the savings to create the assets that will help meet future expenses. If the\ncurrent expenses are controlled, then it contributes to securing the financial future of the\nhousehold. It is essential to understand the nature of income and expenses of the household\nto be able to manage the personal financial situation.\n\n\n# Income has to be regular and stable to be able to be assigned to expenses. The income is first\nused to meet mandatory expenses such as repayment of loans and payment of taxes. The\nremaining income is next used to meet essential expenses, such as the living expenses.\nDiscretionary expenses, such as those on entertainment and recreational activities, are next\n\n\n## 48",

The excess income available is the savings of the household.\nHowever, meeting goals and future needs cannot be done if savings is ad-hoc. Prudent\nfinancial management requires that a defined level of savings should be targeted that is\nessential to meet goals. A budget helps a household plan its income and expenses so that the\nincome available is utilized in the best possible way to meet current and future requirements.\n\n\n# The steps to making a budget are the following:\n\n- List and total the regular and definite incomes that will be received in the period.\n- List and deduct the mandatory expenses from the total income. What is left is the\ndisposable income.\n- Identify essential living expenses of the household and deduct from the disposable income.\n4. List the discretionary expenses and deduct it from available income to arrive at the savings.\nOnce the incomes and expenses are identified and listed, it will be easy to assess where the\nproblem lies, if the savings are seen to be inadequate. The income cannot be expanded\nbeyond a certain level. The focus should be on managing the expenses to enhance savings. If\nthe mandatory expenses are too high, it may be because of the pressure from loan\nrepayments. A debt rationalisation exercise with a financial planner may help reduce the\nburden to some extent. Discretionary expenses and living expenses to some extent are areas\nwhere a household can focus on cutting back or postponing till the income expands to\naccommodate them without compromising on the required savings.\n\n\n## Forecasting or projecting is the ability to look ahead and plan for the future. Forecasting\nrequires looking at the various data and conditions that are present and based on this and the\nexpected changes there is an estimate of the various figures going forward. There are some\nconditions that are related to forecasting that needs to be understood.\n\n- This involves predicting the future situation that is expected to arise. This requires the\nindividual or the household to look at how various events will play out because the final\nforecast will be based on the conditions prevalent at that point of time.\n- There has to be a specific basis on which forecasting is done. This means that it is not just\na random exercise but there is a basis for which the predictions are made. Arriving at the basis\nfor forecasting thus becomes a key aspect.\n- The various evolving conditions are taken into consideration when the forecasting is made.\nThis makes forecasting a dynamic exercise.\n\n\n## 49",

The actual figures when compared\nto the budget plan, will give an idea of how robust the budget planning actually was. It is not\nlikely that every item considered in the budget will end up with the same actual figure, thus\nthe variation witnessed gives a better picture of the strength of the budgeting process.\n\n\n## The monitoring of the budget has to be done on a continuous basis and after looking at the\ndifference seen in the figures further action needs to be taken. This action has to be in the\nform of correcting the budget figures going ahead. If there is an area where there is a constant\nmiss of the budget target then the planning is off track and this needs to be improved through\nfuture changes. For example, if there is a provision of Rs 4,000 a month for conveyance and\nthe average conveyance expense comes to Rs 6,000 for a few months then it is clear that\neither the budget figure has to be raised or the individual has to change the mode of\nconveyance to reduce cost.\n\n\n## The ability to provide various areas of action through monitoring ensures that the budget\nimproves over a period of time. This is the desired outcome from the effort of monitoring.\n\n\n## 50\n\n\n<!-- Page 51 -->\n\n\n# There can be an end of the month monitoring that will give an idea about the actual situation\nbut the effort also depends on the kind of record keeping that is taking place. If there is a\nregular noting down of expense, then even a mid month review can be made so that a better\nidea is available about the manner in which the trend is going and if some specific action is\nrequired in the remaining part of the month.\n\n\n## The final objective of the budgeting process is to have some element of extra amounts left\nwith the individual or the household. This means that the income has to be more than the\nexpenses that are made. This balance figure is the savings that can then be put to better use\nfor the future. All the further steps in the financial planning process can arise only if there are\nsavings generated.\n\n\n## The amount of savings that is actually seen has to be checked in the light of the requirements\nof an individual or household. For example, a person could have a savings of Rs 15,000 per\nmonth but if the goals require an investment of Rs 30,000 a month then this is not enough.\nThe budget and its monitoring will also give a direction about the steps to be undertaken so\nthat the savings can rise and reach to the desired level or target.\n\n\n## There might be a small difference between the savings desired and the actual amount of\nsavings done. If this is there then bridging the gap is not a difficult task. The real challenge is\nwhen the gap between the actual and the desired savings is huge. This will require a step by\nstep approach to raise the savings level. It can consist of some of the following steps.\n\n- A target of raising the savings rate by a specified percentage might be set. This could be\nsomething like 10% which is not too difficult to achieve.\n- The target once achieved would result in a further target being set. This will ensure that\nthere are constant efforts to raise the savings rate.\n- The manner in which the savings come about is also significant. Elimination of wasteful\nexpenditure and cutting down on discretionary expenses are a good way to raise the savings\n\n\n## rate.\n\n- Lumpsum of large receipts should be directly diverted towards savings. This can give a\nboost to the overall savings rate.\n- Higher income should not be committed to some additional expense but this should be left\nfree for contribution to the savings rate.\n\n\n## 3.6 Creating a personal Balance Sheet and net-worth\n\n\n## Creating a personal balance sheet for an individual will require that various assets and\nliabilities are brought together and shown at a single place. A balance sheet shows the\n\n\n## 51",

Things can change after the date and the balance sheet will also change but\nit is necessary to see how things are stacked up at a particular time and this what the balance\nsheet actually provides.\n\n\n# Assets for an individual will include physical assets like property, car etc. and financial asset\nlike investments in equity, debt and mutual funds. There might be some advances received\nby them along with their cash and bank balances which would form current assets. On the\nliabilities side the various loans that they have plus other payments outstanding including\nshort term debt like credit card dues would make up the list. The different between the assets\nand the liabilities would be the net worth of the individual or the household.\n\n\n## The income of a household or individual is at the base of all financial activities it undertakes.\nThe income is used to meet current expenses and a portion is set aside to meet expenses in\nthe future. The portion of current income earmarked for future needs is called savings. The\nadequacy of the income of a household is always relative to its expenses. If the expenses are\nmanaged within the income and there is surplus to save, then the household's finances are\nseen as stable. Short-term imbalances in income and expenses can be managed by loans and\nadvances. The loans are a liability and come at a cost which may further strain the future\nincome. The option of loans to fund expenses must be used with discretion since it weakens\nthe financial situation of the household.\n\n\n## The savings of a household are put to work by investing them in assets. Assets are broadly\nclassified as physical assets and financial assets. Assets may be appreciating in value or\ndepreciating. All assets have a resale value. Investors hold assets for the returns they provide.\nThe nature of return that an asset provides classifies them as growth-oriented, income-\noriented or a combination of the two.\n\n\n## Physical assets are tangible assets and include real estate, gold and other precious metals.\nPhysical assets have an intrinsic value though the actual price at which they trade is impacted\nby demand and supply. They are usually seen as natural hedges against inflation since their\nprice show a positive correlation with inflation. Physical assets are more growth investments\nthat are bought for the appreciation in value rather than the income they generate. Some\nsuch as real estate provide both income and growth while others such as gold are pure\ngrowth-oriented assets. The primary drawbacks of physical assets are illiquidity, lack of\nregulation/limited regulation and the need for specific skills to identify investment\nopportunities, assess the merits of the investment, arrange for the purchase of the asset and\nits management and sale of the asset when required. The other limitation of physical assets\nas an investment is that they are typically large ticket investments and require substantial\nsavings or a combination of savings and loan to acquire.\n\n\n## 52\n\n\n## 32",

These assets\nmay be structured as growth-oriented assets, such as equity investments, or as income-\noriented, such as deposits, or a combination of the two, such as all listed securities. Financial\nassets are typically standardized products and controlled by the regulations in force at the\npoint in time. They may differ on liquidity features, with some such as listed securities\nenjoying high liquidity, while others such as privately placed instruments featuring low\nliquidity. The standardization of financial assets and the mandatory information made\navailable makes evaluation and comparisons more efficient. These assets lend themselves to\ninvestment in small amounts and units. Together, the physical and financial assets represent\nthe investments made by the investor.\n\n\n## While these assets represent financial benefits and returns to the holder, the financial\nstrength of the household depends upon how the assets are acquired. Loans and borrowings\nused to buy assets create a liability and impose a repayment obligation on the buyer and a\ncharge on the future income of the household. Loans taken to buy appreciating assets add to\nthe long-term wealth. Loans taken to buy financial assets, also called leveraging, is risky\nbecause of the higher volatility in the price of such assets. Assets acquired with savings and\nwithout taking on a liability add to the financial strength of the household.\n\n\n## An assessment of the financial well-being of the household can be made by calculating the\nNet worth. The net worth is calculated as Assets – Liabilities. Higher this number better is the\nfinancial position of the household. Net worth should be calculated periodically, and the\nprogress tracked to bring the financial situation to the desired stage.\n\n\n## An example of a personal budget for Lakshmi is given below. A brief analysis of this will give\na better idea about the existing financial situation for her. There is a fixed asset in the form of\na house and a car that is present. As compared to the value of the house, the investment\nfigure is still a bit less and these are also not much into growth assets like equity and equity\noriented mutual funds. The amount lying in the bank is also not very high. On the other side\nthe net worth figure is relatively low because most of the assets have been acquired through\nloans and a large part of these are still outstanding. Over a period of time the changes in the\nnet worth can be seen to see how this is rising along with the value of the assets. The net\nworth is the total assets of Rs 36,22,000 reduced by the total liabilities of Rs 12,07,000 ( Rs\n12,02,000 +5,000) giving the amount as Rs 24,15,000.

This\nwill ensure that the process is done in a step-by-step manner and nothing has been missed\nout. The following steps would be useful in the budget creation process\n\n- Start by gathering all the relevant details about the various sources of income and expenses\nfor the individual or the household. The availability of the basic information is the most crucial\npart of the process, so unless this is present the budget would not reflect the true situation.\n- Check to see that some area has not been missed out in terms of the heads of income or\nthe heads of expenses. This requires going back and looking at the details over and over again.\nThe wider the coverage of the areas, the better the budget will turn out to be.\n- Base the budget figures on either actual expenses that have been made in the past or if this\nhas changed, then the kind of expense that are likely. A record of various expenses would be\nvery useful to arrive at the correct estimate.\n- There has to be some element of change in the various figures in the budget based on the\ntime period for which this is done. For example, when vegetable prices show a seasonal spike\na higher amount needs to be allocated here. A month in which there are a couple of birthdays\nin the family might need a higher allocation for discretionary expenses.\n- There has to be a contingency figure that is present in the budget. There are times when a\nsudden change disrupts everything but this feature would ensure that the budget remains\nrobust.\n\n\n## 54",

    "page_content": "<!-- Page 55 -->\n\n- The amount of savings needed would have to be achieved through the curtailment of\nexpenses within limits. So, the required savings figure based on the goals needs to be present.\n- There has to be a proper allocation of the savings amount and this should be done before\nthe figure is spent elsewhere. This is why there has to be a direct transfer to the various\ninvestments, so that the amount automatically goes each month in the required investments.\n\n\n## Make the savings plan a part of the fixed figure in the budget and this will ensure that there\nare no variations here and that the goal is met.\n\n\n# 3.8 Contingency Planning\n\n\n# Investment advisers need to prepare the client for various contingencies that might come up.\nThe household or individual's financial strategy needs to provide for these risks. The following\nare typical contingencies to provide for:\n\n- A family that is dependent on incomes of both its earning members needs some protection.\nIf anything were to happen to either earning member, the family will be in dire straits. Life\ninsurance mitigates this risk.\n- Healthcare costs are another financial risk for any family. Medical insurance, addresses this\nrisk.\n\n\n## *Income streams are also affected if people lose their jobs. The double income can offer some\nkind of insurance against the job loss risk. If one loses the job, the other hopefully will retain\nthe job. This would ensure that some income keeps coming in every month.\n\n- An emergency fund needs to be the first goal towards which a household or individual\nshould save as a protection against the possibility of loss or reduction of income. The fund\nshould be adequate to meet the expenses for six months, in the event the regular income is\nnot available. The emergency fund should be held in liquid assets, to enable easy access as\nand when required. If income security is high, the fund can also be held in a laddered way,\nwith the equivalent of around three months' expenses being held in liquid assets, and the rest\nof the funds being held in a less liquid assets but which gives better returns. If the emergency\nfund is used then efforts must be made to replenish it as soon as possible. The adequacy of\nthe emergency fund should also be periodically reviewed. It should be done annually or\nwhenever there is a large addition, such as an EMI, to the monthly expenses.\n- Separation (divorce) is another risk that families face. In developed countries, the wealthy\ngo in for pre-nuptial agreements. This is an agreement, entered into before marriage, which\ndetails how the finances (and any other matter) will be dealt with, in the event of a separation.\nThe legality of such pre-nuptial agreements in India has not been established.\n\n\n## 55",

For example, in some investments, one partner\nwill be the first holder, while the other may be a joint holder; the holding pattern can be\nreversed in some other investments.\n- In the case of double income families, the holding pattern can be closely aligned to the\nsource of income of the investment. Investment made out of incomes of one partner can be\nheld with that partner as the first holder.\n- Another approach would be to keep the salary account of each partner distinct (with the\nother partner as joint holder). This account is to be used only for investments, or to transfer\nfunds to another joint account that is used for meeting household expenses. Such segregation\nof investment flows and household expense flow helps in better expense monitoring, as well\nas investment record keeping and tax record keeping.\n- When a housing loan is taken for purchase of property, the partners can be joint owners of\nthe property as well as joint borrowers for the loan.\n\n\n## 3.9 Evaluation of financial position of clients\n\n\n## The personal financial situation of an individual or a household primarily refers to its ability\nto manage its current and future needs and expenses. The income available to do this may be\ndrawn from salary, a business or profession or from the assets created over time by saving\nand investing a portion of the income. Typically, assets are created to meet the future\nexpenses of the household, and financial planning helps apportion the available current\nincome to immediate expenses and savings for the future. Loans are used to meet expenses\nand to create assets, if the income is inadequate to meet all the needs. This creates a liability\nfor the household which also has to be settled in the future from the income.\n\n\n## The efficiency with which the interplay between income, expenses, assets and liabilities are\nhandled by the household determines its financial situation. Insurance planning is an essential\nelement of a financial plan. Insurance is an efficient way of protecting the household finances\nfrom a loss of income or a large, unexpected expense that can derail the financial situation.\nSimilarly, meeting income needs in retirement is an important concern and financial goal for\nall households.\n\n\n# Just as analysts use various ratios to assess the financial position of companies, similarly,\ninvestment advisers use various personal finance ratios to assess the financial position of their\nclients. These ratios are calculated using the income, expenses, savings and investment data\nfor each client and gives a numerical snapshot of their current situation. It helps identify areas\nthat require changes and helps set the course of action for the future. Personal finance ratios\n\n\n## 56",

Some of the important ratios\n\n\n# are as follows:\n\n\n# 3.9.1 Savings Ratio & Expenses Ratio\n\n\n## Savings Ratio is the percentage of annual income that a person is able to save. It is calculated\nas Savings per year/Annual Income.\n\n\n## ABC earns an annual income of Rs. 6 lakhs and saves Rs. 60,000 from the income. The savings\nratio is Rs. 60,000\\divRs . 6,00,000=10\\%.\n\n\n# Savings is not limited to money that is retained in the savings bank account. Money invested\nin fixed deposits, mutual funds, shares, debentures, public provident fund, national savings\ncertificates, post office deposits, real estate, gold and others during the year also form part\n\n\n## of the savings.\n\n\n## Some savings may not even reach the investor during the year. For example, the company's\ncontribution to provident fund or superannuation fund on account of the investor. The money\nwill not go to the investor immediately, but it belongs to the investor and will be available in\nthe investor's account with the provident fund or superannuation fund and will form part of\nthe savings during the year.\n\n\n## Annual income will include all income earned from employment or business and in the form\nof interest, dividend, rent and such other items during the year.\n\n\n# Consider the following information. XYZ earned a gross salary of Rs. 10,000, including\ncompany's contribution to provident fund of Rs. 500. Net take home salary was Rs. 9,000 after\ndeducting Rs. 500 towards employee's contribution to provident fund. XYZ earned Rs. 200\ntowards interest in the savings bank account. Expenses during the month were Rs. 7,000.\nWhat is the savings ratio?\n\n\n## Total Income: Gross salary + Interest income =Rs10,000+200=Rs10,200\n\n\n## Savings: (Net salary + Interest income + Contributions of employer and employee to provident\nfund)-(Expenses)=Rs9,000+Rs200+Rs500+Rs500-Rs7,000=Rs3,20i .\n\n\n## Savings~Ratio:Savings/Total~lncome=Rs3,200\\divRs10,200=31.4\\% .\n\n\n## The Savings to Income ratio measures the total accumulated savings of the individual relative\nto the annual income. It is calculated as Total Savings/Annual Income.\n\n\n## Consider the following information of the financial situation of GGN.\n\n\n## Annual salary: Rs.12,00,000\n\n\n## 57\n\n\n## 57",

The current\nvalue of the investments and assets, after accounting for any outstanding loans taken to\nacquire the same, is taken to compute the total savings. Self-occupied home is typically not\nincluded when calculating the savings level.\n\n\n## The appropriate level for this ratio will depend upon the age of the individual. When the\nindividual is young, expenses are high relative to the income available and the accumulated\nsavings are likely to be low. Moreover, at this stage much of the available surplus is likely to\ngo towards servicing a home loan. The ratio is expected to improve over time, as income goes\nup and expenses stabilize. A suitable savings to income ratio in the early 40s is at least 3 times\nthe annual income. This means that the annual savings rate, or the annual savings relative to\nincome, has to be stepped up as income levels go up, so that the savings can be built to a level\nthat is suitable to the age and stage in life.\n\n\n## In the earlier example, if ABC has saved Rs. 60,000 out of an income of Rs. 6 lakhs, it stands\nto reason that Rs. 6,00,000-Rs . 60,000 i.e. Rs. 5,40,000 was spent towards various expenses.\n\n\n## The Expenses Ratio is calculated as Annual Recurring Expenses ÷ Annual Income. In the case\nof ABC, it amounts to Rs. 5,40,000\\divRs.6,00,000=90\\% .\n\n\n## —\n\nExpenses Ratio can also be calculated as 1 – Savings Ratio. Similarly, Savings Ratio is 1 -\nExpenses Ratio.\n\n\n## Non-recurring expenses are kept out of the expense ratio. For example, if a person incurred\na one-time medical expenses of Rs. 50,000 in a year, then that would be excluded. However,\nif it is found that on an average, every year the family spends Rs. 30,000 towards healthcare\nexpenses (beyond any re-imbursement from employers or insurers), then these would be\nincluded in determining the expense ratio.\n\n\n## Suppose a family goes on a foreign holiday every 3 years, when they spend about Rs. 6,00,000,\nthen its annual equivalent viz. Rs2,00,000 will be considered in the expense ratio.\n\n\n## Expenses may be mandatory, such as taxes, rents, EMIs for loans and necessities for living.\nDiscretionary expenses are those items of expenses that are not essential. Much of the\nreduction and rationalisation of expenses happen with respect to discretionary expenses in\norder to improve the savings ratio. A low expense ratio and high savings ratio is desirable for\nan individual's financial security and stability.\n\n\n## 58",

The current value of these assets constitutes the investor's\ntotal assets. Physical assets such as real estate is typically acquired with a combination of\n\n\n## savings and loans.\n\n\n## A conservative approach would be to exclude personal jewellery, one residential house that\nthe investor's family stays in, and any other form of asset meant for personal use (e.g. car)\nwhile estimating assets available to meet goals and financial needs.\n\n\n# 3.9.3 Total Liabilities\n\nLiabilities include loans and different forms of credit taken to meet expenses or to acquire\n\nassets. These may be taken from institutional sources, such as banks and financial institutions,\n\n\n## or from personal sources such as friends and relatives. Liabilities may be long term and\nsecured on assets, such as mortgage towards purchase of house and car loans. Or they may\nbe short-term and unsecured, such as credit card outstanding and personal loans. Such\nliabilities tend to be more expensive.\n\n\n## Liabilities imply an obligation to repay the loan from the future income. This impacts the\nability of the household to meet other expenses and to save for other assets. It must be used\nwith caution, ideally to acquire assets that appreciate in value. Greater is the liability, more\nshall be the financial pressures on the investor for repayment.\n\n\n# 3.9.4 Leverage Ratio\n\nThis is a measure of the role of debt in the asset build-up of the investor. It is calculated as\n\n\n## Total Liabilities ÷ Total Assets.\n\nFor example, an investor owns real estate worth Rs.50 lakhs, investments and bank balances\n\n\n## valued at Rs.10 lakhs, and Rs.5 lakhs is lying in provident fund account. The real estate was\nbought with a loan of Rs. 30 lakhs, of which Rs. 10 lakhs is currently outstanding. The investor\n\nalso has credit card dues of Rs. 2 lakhs and a loan of Rs.1 lakh from a friend.\n\nTotal assets =Rs.50~lakhs+Rs . 10 lakhs +Rs.5 lakhs i.e. Rs. 65 lakhs.\n\nTotal liabilities = Rs. 10 lakhs + Rs. 2~lakhs+Rs. 1 lakh i.e. Rs. 13 lakhs.\n\n\n## Leverage~Ratio=Rs.13~lakhs\\divRs.65~lakhs~i.e.20\\%\n\n\n## Higher the leverage, more risky it is for the individual's financial situation.

Over\ntime as the asset value appreciates, the ratio will also moderate. Investor needs to look at\nthe leverage in the context of debt servicing capability. Further, investor needs to ensure that\na risky investment position is not compounded with high leverage financing it.\n\n\n# 3.9.5 Net Worth\n\n\n## A strong asset position is of no use, if most of these are acquired through loans that are\noutstanding. Similarly, liability is not bad, if it has been used for creating an asset, such as real\nestate, which has the potential to appreciate in value.\n\nIt is therefore normal to monitor any investor's financial position through the net worth. It is\n\n\n## calculated as Total assets - Total liabilities.\n\n\n## In the previous example,\n\n\n## Net worth =Rs.65~lakhs-Rs. 13 lakhs i.e. Rs. 52 lakhs.\n\n\n## Net worth is monitored over a period of time to monitor improvement or deterioration in the\nfinancial position.\n\n\n# 3.9.6 Solvency Ratio\n\nDespite having assets, a person may be insolvent, if the liabilities are higher than the value of\n\nthe assets held. A critical benchmark is that the individual's net worth should be positive.\n\n\n## The extent of the investor's solvency can be determined through the solvency ratio, which is\ncalculated as Net Worth ÷ Total Assets. For the same asset position, higher the solvency ratio,\nstronger the investor's financial position.\n\nIn the above example, it is calculated as Rs. 52 lakhs\n\n\n## Rs. 65 lakhs i.e. 80%.\n\nIt can also be calculated as 1 – Leverage Ratio. Similarly, Leverage Ratio = 1 – Solvency Ratio.\n\n\n# 3.9.7 Liquid Assets\n\n\n## Liquid assets are those assets that can be easily converted into cash at short notice to meet\nexpenses or emergencies. Liquid assets include money in savings bank account, fixed deposits\nthat mature within 6 months, investment in liquid funds or other mutual funds and such other\nshort-term assets. On the other hand, there are assets that are not easy to convert into cash.\n\nFor example, it can take a long time to sell real estate at the fair value and realize it.\n\n\n## Closed-end mutual fund units may not be as easily realizable as units of open-end mutual\nfund units. Some assets may be easily converted into cash but their values may fluctuate\n\n\n## 60\n\n\n<!-- Page 61 -->\n\n\n# widely in the short-term, thus making them unsuitable for realising cash at short notice.\nShares and open-end equity schemes fall under this category. Open-end debt schemes too\nhave a significant market element in their valuation which makes their return volatile, and\ntherefore unsuitable to meet the need for funds at short notice.\n\n\n# More the money in liquid assets, lesser are the chances of the investor getting caught in a\nliquidity crunch. However, keeping the entire money in liquid assets is not a sensible solution.\nLiquidity comes at a cost. For example, banks usually offer lower rate of interest on shorter-\nterm fixed deposits; liquid schemes may yield a lower return than longer-term debt schemes.\n\n\n## Investors therefore need to balance their liquidity and return needs. Keep enough in liquid\nassets to meet liquidity requirements, and invest the balance in longer term assets with a\nview to earning superior return.\n\n\n# 3.9.8 Liquidity Ratio\n\n\n## The role of liquid assets is to meet the near-term liquidity needs of the individual. It is normal\nto calculate the liquidity needs as the expenses that an investor will incur over the following\n6 months (including loan repayments). In exceptional situations, expenses over a longer\nperiod may be considered.\n\n\n## Liquidity ratio measures how well the household is equipped to meet its expenses from its\nshort-term assets.

Even though\nincome might be higher than expenses it is not possible to finance every purchase or asset\nwith just the existing savings. For example, most people cannot buy a house without a loan.\nThis is because the cost of a house is huge and if people waited till they had enough savings\nto buy a house then it is likely that this would not be possible till they near retirement. Lenders\nprotect themselves by securing their loan against a charge or security or pledge or mortgage\non the property. Such loans are also called 'mortgages'.\n\n\n# Other debt includes auto loans, credit taken for buying consumer durables, personal loans\nand credit card outstanding. However, debt comes at a cost and imposes a repayment\nobligation on the borrower. The decision on whether or not to use debt will depend upon the\nability of the available income to bear the additional charge of interest cost and repayment.\nDebt is not always bad, it has to be seen in perspective as to what is it being spent for. As an\nexample, debt for acquisition of house property is not bad. In some cases, the decision to use\nborrowed funds over own funds, also called leverage, may actually increase the return made\non an investment (Modigliani-Miller Theorem (M&M)). In some cases, a loan may make more\nsense in a given situation. For example, an education loan may be a better choice than\n\n\n## 64",

The future income would\nbe easily able to repay the loan and at the same time the existing funds can continue to earn\nwithout losing the benefit of compounding. Continuation of existing investments is important,\nto maintain the compounding effect.\n\n\n## It can be seen that debt is needed under various circumstances and sometimes it can be also\n\n\n## for temporary use of funds. This kind of short-term needs might arise due to some emergency\nor some cash flow mismatch but it can ensure that an individual is able to continue on their\n\n\n## life path without facing sudden disruptions.\n\n\n## 4.2 Role and impact of debt in cash flow management\n\n\n## While some debt is good and may even be recommended, how much debt is good depends\nupon the financial situation of each household. A good indicator is the debt-to-income ratio\n(DTI) that measures the ability to meet the obligations arising from debt with the available\nincome. There is no \"perfect or optimal\" DTI ratio that lenders require, but all lenders tend to\nagree that a lower DTI is better. Depending on the size and type of loan they're issuing, lenders\nset their own limits on how low your DTI must be for loan approval.\n\n\n# Consider a salaried employee who draws a salary of Rs. 15,000 per month, and is paying\nRs7,500 towards debt servicing. The debt servicing ratio comes to .7,500\\divRs15,000 i.e.\n50%. This too high. If 50% goes towards debt servicing, it affects the ability to meet other\nregular expenses, provide for emergencies and the person may have nothing left to invest for\n\n\n## the future.\n\n\n# The interest rate and the amount of debt play an important role as far as the measurement\nof the impact of the debt is concerned. A higher interest rate will raise the repayment amount\nthat will have to be paid and similarly a higher loan amount will also increase the monthly\nrepayment amount. One has to look at the cash flow and then decide on the amount of debt\n\n\n## that will be taken.\n\n\n## All this needs to be done to ensure that the debt and its outflow do not disrupt the entire\ncash flow management plan laid out. Often there could be a situation wherein the debt\nservicing needs are high and at the same time a crisis on some other front can leave little\nroom for borrowing some more amounts to tide over it. This is also the reason why the debt\nservicing amount needs to be low so that there is scope for raising some more funds in case\nthis is required.\n\n4.2.1 Differentiating between consumption expenditure and investment expenditure\n\n\n# Many clients have an endless list of lifestyle expenses. The Investment Adviser should be able\nto influence the client to be prudent in the expenditure. This can be done by highlighting how\nexpenditure might affect the chances of the family being able to fulfil some other financial\n\n\n## 65",

Consumption expenditure is that amount which\nonce used does not create any asset that generates further income. Amount spent at a\nrestaurant or for buying clothes or expenses made at a saloon are some examples of\nconsumption expenditure. On the other hand investment expenditure will lead to the\ncreation of an asset, which then can generate further income in the future. The trade-offs\nshould be clearly understood by the client. For example, buying a bond or a property can be\ninvestment expenditure.\n\n\n## Some outflows, like providing education to children, may appear to be consumption\nexpenditure. But they may be a useful investment, if the children do well and are able to raise\nthe family's income. Such expenditure needs to be prioritized. A budget that clearly\ndemarcates mandatory and legal payments such as taxes, contributions to provident fund and\ngratuity and loan commitments, essential living expenses such as food and shelter and\ndiscretionary expenses such as lifestyle expenses, will help allocate income better between\ncurrent and future needs. Allocate savings for goals before considering the discretionary\nexpenses. This will make sure that the future needs are taken care of. Systematic investment\nplan (SIPs), especially when automatically transferred from the salary, helps in prioritizing the\ninvestment expenditure.\n\n\n## The approach of people should be, instead of Income minus Expenses = Savings i.e. save only\nafter expenses, to make it Income minus Savings = Expenses i.e. spend after savings.\n\n\n## 4.2.2 Identifying the holes in the household budget\n\n\n## A household may not be managing its income and expenses efficiently to enable savings for\ngoals. Some common errors that make it seem as if savings are not possible include not being\nclear if an expense is an essential living expense or discretionary in nature, incorrect (higher)\nallocation for expenses, not 'paying self' before allocating for discretionary expenses, not\ntracking expenses regularly and hence going over-budget, among others. Very often, clients\ndo not realise how much money goes in various avoidable expenses. The adviser should\ninculcate the habit in the client, to note down all expenses above a specific level. The limit\nmay be Rs.500 for some clients; Rs.5,000 for some others. The actual figure would depend on\nthe income level of the client.\n\n\n# A summarisation of the list of expenses at the end of the month can be enlightening, even for\nthe client. For example, the amount that went in eating out or entertainment might be pretty\nhigh but this might not register for the client because all payments were made by credit card\nso this was not actually tracked. When the client recognises the scale of the lost opportunity\nto save, there is better likelihood of prudence in future. An adviser's primary role is to identify\nand eliminate these lacunae that inhibit savings. There are often cases where a lot of money\nis spent on buying the latest gadgets when this is not necessary. Spending on a gadget like a\n\n\n## 66",

However constant upgradation just so that they have the\nlatest model to show off is not a wise way to spend money and the amount saved from such\nexpenses can be used at several other places.\n\n\n# 4.2.3 Allocation to various categories of expenses\n\n\n## The monthly summary of outflows helps in understanding the current prioritization. If unusual\nexpenses are kept out (for instance, a hospitalization that was not covered by insurance), the\nbalance outflows can be categorized as mandatory contributions to provident fund and other\nretirement savings, loan servicing, essential expenses and lifestyle expenses.\n\n\n## Families vary in their financial circumstances. The advisor should work with the family in\nsetting limits on various categories of outflows. The household can make additional savings\npossible by changing their choices on the expenses they incur. An essential expense does not\nlend itself to much reduction but lifestyle expenses can be controlled to a large extent.\nConsidering the alternate use to which the income can be used instead of spending it on\ndiscretionary expenses is one way in which such expenses can be controlled.\n\n\n## In corporate finance, there is a concept of ‘zero base budgeting' which means, rather than\ntaking the previous budget as the reference point and modifying the numbers, take it from\nscratch. In that case, each and every expense is thought through, and is not incurred just\nbecause it was incurred earlier. The concept can be applied in household finances as well.\n\n\n## 4.2.4 Windfalls\n\n\n## Clients occasionally earn a windfall such as unexpectedly high annual bonus, inheritance,\nwinning a lottery, etc.. A healthy portion of such unexpected income should be set apart for\nthe future, since the family is used to living without that windfall. This can also be the time to\ntake a look at the outstanding loans and consider pre-paying some of them.\n\n\n## Windfall gain need not be invested immediately, and can be deployed as and when\nappropriate. The gain may be held in risk free liquid assets, till investment decision is reached.\nThe amount of the windfall should be properly allocated as the extent of the windfall matters.\nFor example, a very high annual bonus a year can be used to prepay loans and at the same\ntime make some additional investments too, which can yield a return in the future. One\nshould not expect a windfall to occur regularly in the hope that this will save a bad financial\nsituation, as this can encourage wayward financial behaviour and still end up with a higher\namount of debt when the windfall does not materialise.\n\n\n## 67",

Many factors\nwill vary for a client and each of these needs to be taken into consideration when a specific\nplan is put forward. Some of the factor here includes the following:\n\n\n## 4.3.1 Purpose of the debt\n\n\n## Debt or loan should ideally be taken for acquiring appreciating assets such as real estate.\nSome debt may be recommended to meet an expense that will increase the value of an asset,\nsay an education loan to upskill, so that the income generating ability of the person goes up.\nFinancing risky or volatile investment propositions with debt may entail high risk and may put\nthe entire financial security of the individual or household at risk. Margin financing for stock\nmarket investing is one such investment. A fall in the value of the investment will magnify the\nloss since the cost of debt will also have to be accounted for. Debt should certainly not be\nused for financing one's regular expenses. If a person starts borrowing to meet expenses, then\nhe is clearly living beyond his means and likely to be in a debt trap. Taking short term debt to\ntide over temporary liquidity problems may be fine, as long as the borrower knows the risk\nand has a plan to repay the debt as soon as possible.\n\n\n## 4.3.2 Cost of debt\n\n\n## Higher the rate of interest at which money is borrowed, more will be the outgo in servicing\nthe debt. Secured loans, such as mortgages, and education loans are relatively cheaper as\nthere is the benefit of the security available to the lender. Unsecured loans such as personal\nloans and credit card debt are very expensive and must be used with caution. Credit card is\nan interest free borrowing option only if the use is within the limits specified, and the\nrepayments are made by the due date each month. When the credit card user does not pay\nthe entire amount i.e. some amount is carried over for payment in the following business\ncycles, it is called “revolving credit\". If a credit card company charges 3% p.m. as interest, the\ncompounded annual cost is (1+3%)^12-1 i.e. 42.6%. Given the exorbitant cost, revolving credit\nshould be avoided. A similar argument can be made for loans for unorganized sector like pawn\ntraders or money lenders who charge as high as 60-80% interest rate or 5% a month from\npeople.\n\n\n## 4.3.3 Maturity of debt\n\n\n# Shorter the tenor of the loan; more will be the periodic repayment putting pressure on\navailable income. Even if the cost of debt is low, short loan tenor can put financial pressures\nin repayment. Therefore, loan tenor should be decided keeping in mind the repayment\ncapacity of the borrower. A longer tenor loan translates into higher interest paid over the\n\n\n## 68",

The debt-to-income ratio can be used as an indicator of what the household income\ncan take on as repayment obligations, and decide on the tenor accordingly.\n\n\n# 4.3.4 Debt Re-scheduling\n\n\n# If the borrower is unable to manage the debt repayments, then it helps to work out a solution\nas soon as possible. Potential solutions are as follows:\n\n- Rank debt in order of their cost and deal with the costliest debt first. Typically, credit card\ndues and personal loans will be the most expensive, and work to eliminate them from the\noutstanding debt list. Low-cost debt and debt that provide tax benefits such as home loans\nand education loans can be dealt with later when finances permit.\n- If the debt was taken for purchasing an asset, then the asset can be sold and the proceeds\nused for pre-paying the debt provided the asset has a reasonable realisable value. While doing\nthis, the borrower should also plan for any pre-payment charges that the bank may levy.\n- If the cost of debt is high, then cheaper re-financing is an option. A lower cost loan can be\navailed to repay the costlier loan. A credit card balance transfer is an example of such\nrefinancing.\n- If the problem is with the tenor of the loan, then the possibility of extending the tenor of\nthe loan can be explored. This will reduce the monthly outgo in debt servicing. However, the\nloan will be repaid over a longer period of time and the total interest paid over the tenor of\nthe loan will go up.\n- If none of these is possible, then the borrower should inform the lender about the problem\nand explore a revised loan schedule. It should however be noted that such re-scheduling of\nloans hurts the borrower's credit history (also known as credit score like CIBIL score). This will\naffect the chances of obtaining loans in future or the cost at which they will become available.\n\n\n## 4.4 Calculate the debt servicing requirements\n\n\n## 4.4.1 Role of Credit Bureaus and Credit Score\n\n\n# Credit score is a number assigned to each individual by a credit information bureau based on\ntheir credit behaviour and repayment history. A credit bureau is licenced by the RBI and\ngoverned by the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005. The credit and\nfinancial health of the individual is assessed on the basis of the outstanding loans and credit\nfacilities used, repayment behaviour exhibited, utilization of credit limits, type of loans i.e.\nthe proportion of credit card outstanding, personal loans and other unsecured loans, and\nother factors that may affect the ability to service loans. This information is reported on a\nmonthly basis by providers of loans and credit to the credit information companies. Here it is\n\n\n## 69",

For example, the CIBIL\nTransUnion Score is a three digit number ranging from 300 to 900.\n\n\n# Banks, Housing Finance Companies, NBFCs use this score and report for making decisions on\na loan application to determine interest rate, loan eligibility and credit limits. A high credit\nscore makes the lender consider the loan application and the terms of offer.\n\n\n## A good credit score and credit report can be built by dealing with debt responsibly. Always\npay dues on loans, credit cards and others on time. Credit utilization relative to credit\navailable should be kept low. Too much of unsecured loans such as credit cards or high\nutilization on your credit card limits and personal loans have a negative impact on the score.\nFor a good score it is important to have a mix of secured and unsecured credit and to apply\nfor credit, or make credit enquiries only when required, and in moderation. A person's credit\nscore is also affected by the repayment behaviour in loans where they are joint holders or\nguarantors. Review the credit report periodically so that any errors can be identified and\nrectified.\n\n\n## Accessing your credit score\n\n\n## In order to have access to your credit score the client has to go to a credit bureau that is\nlicensed to operate in the country. The various personal details can be mentioned to the\nbureau and the appropriate credit score and even the credit report can be taken. The credit\nreport will not just have the score but all the details of the various loans outstanding and\nthose that the client has serviced or missed payments on or even settled.\n\n\n## The credit bureaus allow for online access to the details for an individual, so this is also an\noption that can be used to directly access the credit score. The client can open their account\nwith their login details and password on the website of the credit bureau and then check the\ndetails. There is also a tie-up by the credit bureaus with various loan providers, so the client\ncan also get their credit score from such loan providers. One has to be careful about accessing\nthe credit score this way because one has to be sure that there is a genuine tie up for access\nto such scores and that this is not some online scam targeting people for their personal\ninformation.\n\n\n## RBI's regulation about free credit score\n\n\n# The importance of credit scores is increasing with each passing day and there is a greater\nemphasis on this aspect while a new loan is sanctioned by various banks and financial\ninstitutions. In order to protect the customer and enable them to get the right kind of\ninformation, RBI has introduced some specific conditions with respect to free credit scores.\nSome of the highlights here include:\n\n\n## 70\n\n\n<!-- Page 71 -->\n\n- Every individual is entitled to a free copy of their credit report every year from each credit\nbureau also known as credit information companies. In India, you can access the same from\nCIBIL, EXPERIAN, CRIF Highmark and Equifax.\n- The customer should get a full copy of such a credit report which is the same as what is\naccessed by the financial institutions when they check the credit details of a borrower.\n- The report should also enable the borrower to rectify the mistakes like wrong info, loan\nclosure if any, present in the credit report.\n- The credit report will have the credit score plus the details of the latest outstanding loans\nthat are there for the individual. Typically, the report shows, repayment history for last 2-3\nyears\n- The year for this purpose is from January to December or a calendar year.\n- The report can be accessed in electronic format.\n- The report can be given after the necessary checks for authentication of the individual is\ndone like UID, PAN etc. Credit scoring reports are also available for non-individuals like\ncompanies etc..\n\n\n# 4.5 Responsible Borrowing\n\n\n## Every individual has a need for some sort of debt or borrowings for meeting their various\nfinancial needs. Since there are several assets that are big ticket purchases, there is a need to\nhave some debt to finance their purchases. Similarly, the use of electronic and plastic\npayment methods ensure that the individual is able to incur some expenses and pay them off\nin a few days. All these are facilities for an individual but they need to be used responsibly.\n\n\n## One of the key points that every individual needs to follow is that they should never borrow\nmore than what they can afford. A lifestyle that is flashy might seem enchanting but there is\na cost that has to be paid for this and if this is not sustainable then it is better to not go down\nthat path. In terms of expenses an individual should be responsible enough to buy only those\nthings for which they can make payments. The best way to use a credit card is to pay off the\namounts by the due date and not leave any amount as revolving credit.\n\n\n## On the loan front it is better to borrow for assets that are value appreciating in nature and\nwhich can yield some income down the line. Also, too many loans at the same time can make\ndebt servicing very difficult and hence this has to be avoided. Ensuring that debt options are\nused responsibly will ensure that this is sustained over a longer time period and at the same\ntime the goals are also attained.\n\n\n## 71",

One is secured loans and as the name suggests these loans are backed\nby some asset as security. The most common example of such a secured loan is that of housing\nloans. When an individual takes a housing loan the lender takes the house as a security or\nmortgage. This is a source of comfort for the lender in case the borrower is not able to repay\nthe money. The asset that is present as security remains in the name of the borrower but in\ncase the loan is not repaid then the lender can take over and dispose of the asset to recover\nthe money. The most visible outcome of such a security is that the interest rates on such loans\nare relatively lower. Vehicle loans, Gold loans, loans against securities are some other\nexamples of secured loans.\n\n\n## Unsecured loans are those loans where the lender does not take any security from the\nborrower. In such loans there is just the personal security or guarantee of the borrower to\nrepay the amount, so this is more risky in terms of lending. The outcome is that such loans\nare costlier in terms of a higher interest rate to be paid by the borrower. Examples of such\nloans are personal loans and credit card dues. The interest rate on such loans can be quite\nsteep.\n\n\n## Clients should be advised to use secured loans for building long term assets as the cost will\nbe lower if needed and ensure that the unsecured loans are kept to a minimum or regularly\npaid before the interest cycle kicks in on credit cards.\n\n\n## 4.7 Terms related to loans\n\n\n# 4.7.1 Fixed Rate Loans\n\n\n## Fixed rate loans are those loans where the interest rate on the loan is fixed for the entire\nduration of the loan. This enables the borrower to know the exact cost that they would face\nover the entire duration of the loan. Fixed rate loans are useful when the interest rates are\nlow and the borrower wants to lock into these low rates.\n\n\n## 4.7.2 Variable or Floating Rate Loans\n\n\n## Variable rate loans are also known as floating rate loan. These loans have an interest rate that\nchanges or gets reset periodically with the changes to the benchmark rate to which this is\nlinked. Variable rate loans can be linked to an external benchmark like the repo rate or an\nexternal bank benchmark rate like the Marginal Cost of Lending Rate (MCLR). These types of\nloans are preferred by borrowers for long term loans especially when they feel that the rates\nare likely to fall over a period of time.\n\n\n## 4.7.3 Home equity loan\n\n\n## 122\n\n\n## 72",

In such a loan the borrower\nuses the home or any other real estate as collateral for the purpose of taking a loan. The home\nis the asset of the individual and they are thus borrowing against the security of this asset.\nThe borrowing enables them to raise money which can be used for several purposes. The\nvalue of the property and the extent to which the lending institution gives money against the\nvalue is what will determine the extent of the home equity loan.\n\n\n## 4.7.4 Hire purchase\n\n\n## A hire purchase agreement is one where an individual agrees to buy a certain asset by paying\ninstalments over a period of time. There is an initial payment that is made followed by several\ninstalments over a given time period. The person paying the amounts becomes the owner of\nthe asset when the final instalment is paid. This separates the hire purchase transaction from\na lease because here the individual can become the owner of the asset at the end of the\nagreement period when all payments are made.\n\n\n## 4.7.5 Lease\n\n\n## A lease is a contractual agreement where the owner of an asset called the lessor allows\nanother person called the lessee to use the asset for a certain period of time in exchange for\nthe payment of lease. Assets like property, vehicles, machinery etc. are those where a lease\nagreement is normally seen. The difference in a lease as compared to a hire purchase is that\nthe lessor will remain the owner of the asset and the lessee cannot become the owner even\nafter the specified lease period is over. This is largely used for vehicles by large companies.\n\n\n## 4.7.6 Amortisation\n\n\n## The process of amortisation of a loan is one where the capital borrowed is repaid over a\nperiod of time. This is done through fixed payments which are also known as Equated monthly\nInstalments (EMI). The entire repayment amount is converted into equal fixed amount called\nthe EMI. This gives an element of stability and certainty to the repayments and the borrower\nknows exactly how much they need to repay each month.\n\n\n## However, there is a schedule to the whole amortisation whereby the EMI repaid consists of\nboth capital and interest in different proportions. The amortisation chart will list out the\nbreakup of the EMI into the interest and capital component each month. There is a higher\nelement of interest component in the EMI repayments in the earlier period of the loan which\nbecomes smaller as the capital component increases with time.\n\n\n## 4.7.7 Refinancing\n\n\n## The act of refinancing a loan means that an individual repays an existing loan by taking\nanother loan either to extend the duration of loan or lower the interest cost. The reason for\n\n\n## 73",

    "page_content": "<!-- Page 74 -->\n\n\n# doing this is that there is a lower interest rate on the new loan which will reduce the overall\noutgo because a lesser amount has to be paid on the loan. The refinancing is usually done for\nlong term loans or for those loans where the amount outstanding is high as in these cases the\nsavings on the interest will also be higher. An example is refinancing a home loan when the\ndifference between the existing rate paid by the borrower and the new available rate is\nsignificant.\n\n\n## 4.7.8 Prepayment\n\n\n## There is a specific schedule that is prepared for every loan wherein the total amount to be\nrepaid is broken down into equal instalments. There are times when the borrower has some\nextra amounts and they would like to reduce the outstanding amount of the loan. At such a\npoint they can go and make a prepayment which is paying back the capital before the\nspecified time. The prepayment will reduce the capital and it will reduce the remaining EMI\nperiod too on the loan. Lots of loans, restrict the prepayment of the loans for certain periods\nlike 12 months or levy charges for prepayment e.g. car loan. RBI has mandated that there\nwould be no pre-payment charges for home loans taken from banks.\n\n\n## 4.7.9 Pre EMI interest\n\n\n## The Pre EMI interest refers to the monthly payments that are made on the loan which includes\nonly the interest component being repaid. Normally a loan will not have capital amount\nrepaid till the time that the entire loan is disbursed. This kind of pre-EMI interest is usually\npresent for house properties that are not yet complete and hence the full amount of the loan\nhas not been taken or possession has not been received for the property. The amount that is\nbeing repaid here just consists of the interest component and the normal EMI repaying both\ncapital and interest will start at a later date.\n\n\n## 4.7.10 Moratorium\n\n\n## Moratorium refers to a period wherein the repayments on a loan are stopped temporarily or\nfor a certain period of time because of some extraordinary factors also known as (a.k.a) force\nmajeure or tough conditions including some crisis or war or similar situation. The important\nthing is that under normal circumstances non-payment of the regular EMI will be considered\na default but under a moratorium there is a pause and no default is counted. This does not\naffect the credit score and credit history of the borrower. The interest meter during the\nmoratorium continues so the dues of the borrower keep increasing. The EMI missed during\nthe moratorium are pushed back but they will have to be repaid with the additional interest.\nFor example, banks and financial institutions have given several months of moratorium to\nborrowers following the Covid outbreak. During Covid-period moratorium, many consumers\nassumed the EMIs for this period is being done away with, without realizing that the meter is\nstill on, with compound interest.\n\n\n## 74",

In simple words, a home\nloan backed by the security of the property is also called a mortgage. Individuals use\nmortgages to buy properties without putting up the entire money upfront as this allows them\nto repay the amount over a period of time. It allows for leverage in buying an asset which they\nwould otherwise not be able to afford.\n\n\n## 4.7.12 Pledge\n\n\n## A pledge is something that is held as a security on a contract. In case of a debt this is an asset\nthat is held and which can be sold by the lender in case the borrower is not able to repay the\namount. Under a pledge the asset which is usually a movable asset remains with the lender\ntill the loan is repaid. This can be contrasted with a mortgage which is for an immovable asset.\n\n\n## 4.7.13 Hypothecation\n\n\n## This is a term used for creating a charge against an asset but in this case the asset remains\nwith the borrower. In this sense it differs from a pledge where the asset is with the lender. If\nthere is a default then the lender will have to first take possession of the asset and then sell\nit. The best example of hypothecation is that of a car loan where the asset is with the user\nand if there is a default the lender comes and repossesses the car.\n\n\n## 4.8 Types of borrowing\n\n\n# 4.8.1 Home Loan\n\n\n## A home loan is a loan that is taken for the purchase of a house property. This can be to\npurchase a constructed property or it can be an under-construction property. In case of an\nindividual, those who buy a house either for living or for investment can take a loan for the\npurpose. The loan is taken because the cost of the house is high and it is not possible for\neveryone to pay the full amount from their own financial resources. The home loan is the\namount that is borrowed from the financial institution to pay for the purchase of the property.\n\n\n## Home loans are a long-term loan and the period for this can stretch even for 30 to 35 years\nsubject to working age limits. This makes it a significant loan because even the amount of the\nloan is likely to be large. The interest that is paid on the loan will thus be huge since it stretches\nover a longer time period. The security against the loan is the property itself and the financial\ninstitution takes the property documents and keeps it with itself till the loan is repaid.\n\n\n## 75",

Courses for post-graduation or higher\neducation and in many cases even graduation have become very expensive. This can make it\ndifficult for someone with low savings or without large assets to actually finance the\neducation of their children. An education loan is one which is used to fund the cost of\neducation. This is not a very long-term loan as the time period of repayment is usually 5 to 8\nyears.\n\n\n## One of the features of an education loan is that the repayment usually starts after the\ncompletion of the education course or when the person completing the course starts earning\nwhichever is earlier. Till this time the interest keeps accumulating on the loan. The loan can\nbe repaid by the parent or even by the child who was educated.\n\n\n## 4.8.3 Vehicle loan\n\n\n## A vehicle, be it a two-wheeler or a four-wheeler, is now a requirement for many people across\nthe country. The lack of proper public transport plus the convenience of an owned vehicle\nmakes this an essential asset. A loan that is taken for the purpose of purchase of a vehicle is\ncalled a vehicle loan. The vehicle is hypothecated against the loan and the individual is then\nable to use the vehicle.\n\n\n## The vehicle loan is usually for a period of 3 to 7 years and the longer the time period the lower\nwill be the EMI but the total interest paid will keep climbing. The individual has to choose the\nright time period and the EMI which is affordable to them plus it does not put too much\nburden in terms of interest payments since the vehicle is usually a depreciating asset.\n\n\n# 4.8.4 Business Loan\n\n\n## A loan that is taken for the purpose of conducting business or profession is a business loan.\nThis differs from an individual taking a loan to purchase an asset. In this case, the amount\nwould be used for the purpose of running the business. The lending institution would look at\nthe financial position of the business and whether it would be able to repay the amount that\nhas been borrowed. For this purpose, the working capital requirement and various turnover\nratios are also seen along with the strength of the balance sheet.\n\n\n## A business loan can often have the security of an asset so that there is additional comfort for\nthe lender or it could be that the goods that are produced are hypothecated in the form of\nstock i.e. goods/inventory. There are often overall limits for the business loan and the amount\nthat is required is utilised. Depending on the nature of the business and the economic cycle\nthere could be different amounts that can be used on this loan at varying time periods.\n\n\n## 76",

The full amount that is required\nmight not be available at that specific time. At other times they might have to pay for some\nexpense like a medical emergency or some other debt repayment that cannot be done due\nto lack of funds. In such times, there is a personal loan which can be taken. This loan is one\nwhich can be used for any purpose and there is no fixed area in which this has to be spent.\n\n\n## The personal loan is given without any security and hence it is called a personal loan, which\nan individual can use any way they want. There are no restrictions on its usage but there is a\ncost that comes with this freedom. A personal loan is far more expensive than a normal loan\nbacked by an asset and one has to be very careful when using such loans because they are\neasy to get. The amount of such loans can be easily spent but paying back can become a\nproblem if care is not taken.\n\n\n## 4.8.6 Credit card debt\n\n\n## Credit card is a way to access short term credit for an individual. A credit card has a specified\nspending limit and a person can use the credit card to spend up to the limit. At the end of the\nbilling period cycle the total amount that has been spent is the amount to be repaid on the\ncredit card. Payment of the amount by the due date will not involve any charge but if a part\nof the amount is carried forward then the interest meter starts ticking. Since this is an\nunsecured loan there is a large interest charged on credit card remaining unpaid which makes\nit a very expensive way to borrow.\n\n\n## Credit card debt is the most expensive way to borrow but it is also the easiest because an\nindividual needs to just swipe the card or enter the details online and the transaction is\ncompleted. People end up spending far more than what they would be able to repay\nimmediately and they end up getting stuck in the revolving credit cycle. With a high rate of\ninterest, the dues also keep increasing at a quick rate so one has to be very careful in keeping\ncontrol over expenses when using credit cards.\n\n\n## 4.8.7 Overdraft\n\n\n## A bank account allows an individual to use the money that is present in the account. The\nnormal way of using the account is that one can spend only upto the balance that is present\nin the account. There are times when a higher amount is required for just a few days or a\nshort time period and taking a loan for such a situation would take up too much effort and be\ntime consuming too. The solution is an overdraft wherein the individual is allowed to use\nmore than the balance in the account up to the limit specified in the overdraft. The overdraft\nfacility is usually used by businesses.\n\n\n## 77",

Any amount received can be deposited into the bank account and this would\nautomatically reduce the overdraft amount. This is a flexible and easy way to access short\nterm credit.\n\n\n## 4.8.8 Loan against securities, gold, property etc.\n\n\n## There is a category of loans which is in the nature of secured loans. There are various assets\nlike some investment in a mutual fund or shares or even gold that is available with the\nindividual. If there is some need for money then instead of selling the asset there is an option\nto take a loan against the asset. In this type of loan, the individual uses the security as\ncollateral and gets a loan which has to be repaid according to the schedule that has been set\nup.\n\n\n## The loan that is taken under this route is given at a certain percentage of the value of the\nasset as per RBI guidelines. In case there is a sharp downward movement in the price of the\nasset then the bank can also ask the borrower to deposit some money to cover the change in\nvalue. A large loan can also be taken in the form of loan against property, wherein the asset\nis used to raise money. The repayment capacity of the borrower is considered in deciding the\namount that is sanctioned so this remains an important factor. Loans against an asset or\nsecurity is preferred over personal loan or credit card outstanding, provided you have an\nasset, as the rates are lower.\n\n\n## 4.8.9 P2P loans\n\n\n## Peer to Peer loans, also known as P2P loans, involve one person lending to another person\ndirectly instead of a financial institution lending to an individual. There are P2P lending\nplatforms where a person can register themselves and then give or take loans. What happens\nin these types of loans is that an individual is giving money to another person and this is an\nunsecured credit because there is no security behind the lending. There is a basic background\ncheck that is made of the people on the platform but this does not reduce the risk for the\nlender.\n\n\n# The risk for the lender is that the amount might not be repaid. Since this is an unsecured\nlending there is a high risk that if the borrower might not be able to repay the money there is\nno recourse to some asset to recover the amount. This is why the interest rates on such loans\nare quite high, although the amounts are very low. The time period for the borrowing is\nusually short term and it is an easy way to get some funds when there is an immediate need\nfor money. The borrower is able to borrow smaller amounts using these platforms and that\n\n\n## 78",

This is a growing field and lenders as well as borrowers need to\nbe alert about the conditions and features of the loan when they use this mode to transact.\n\n\n# 4.9 Understand loan calculations\n\n\n# Many investors need assistance in understanding how much loan is good for them. The\nfinancial pressures arising from debt are linked to debt repayment.

FV=0\n\n\n## -\n\n\n## The point to note is that b, c and d in the table are defined in terms of per period – a year in\nthe above case. If each year Rs. 27,740.97 is to be paid, then the monthly payment would be\nRs. 27,740.97\\div12 i.e. Rs. 2,311.75, payable for 5\\times12 i.e. 60 months. This instalment\nrepresents a combination of principal and interest.\n\n\n## If the debt is at 1% per month interest and loan is to be repaid in 5 years, interest per period\nwould be 1% and number of periods would be 60. Accordingly, the equated instalment would\nbe Rs. 2,224.44 by changing the variables.\n\n\n## Lenders use the term 'rest' to indicate the interest charging cycle, which can be different from\nthe payment cycle. For example, interest is chargeable at 12% p.a. on annual reset. The\nrepayment obligation needs to be worked out, initially for the interest charging cycle (period\n=1 year in this example). Thereafter, each instalment is calculated. Thus, if payment cycle is\nquarterly, the annual instalment is to be divided by 4; monthly instalment is calculated by\ndividing the annual instalment by 12.\n\n\n## Suppose interest is chargeable on annual reset and payment cycle is monthly. The implication\nfor the borrower is that although repayments are being made monthly, the lender will adjust\n\n\n## 79",

Since borrower is not\ngetting credit for payments made during the year, the effective borrowing cost turns out to\nbe higher than the interest rate quoted by the borrower.\n\n\n## If the borrower earns Rs. 10,000 per month, and this is the only debt, then debt servicing ratio\nwould be Rs2,224.44 ÷ Rs10,000 i.e. 22.24%.\n\n\n## This can be reduced by increasing the tenor or reducing the interest cost or reducing the\namount borrowed. Suppose the tenor is extended to 6 years. Then the EMI changes from\nRs.2,224.44 to Rs 1955.02. The revised debt servicing ratio is 19.55%.\n\n\n## If the borrower has another loan on which repayment is Rs1,000 per month, then total debt\nservicing is Rs1,955.02+ Rs1,000 i.e. Rs2,955.02. Debt servicing ratio would then be 29.55%.\n\n\n## 4.10 Loan restructuring\n\n\n# There might be some sort of financial stress for the borrower that would make them unable\nto pay the loan that has been taken. For an individual this can happen when they lose their\njob and their income stops or it could happen when they face a sharp reduction in their\nincome either through a pay cut for an employee or through loss of business or professional\nincome for others. The financial institution would not like the loan to become a non\n\nperforming asset and hence they would want to ensure that there is a loan restructuring.\n\n\n# Under a loan restructuring there is a change in the conditions related to an existing loan. This\ncould involve a reduction in the EMI that is being paid so that the loan becomes affordable or\nit could be an increase in the time period for repayment. These have to be seen in two ways\nwhere the first is the affordability for the client. This should fit into their financial condition,\nso that it does not disrupt their other payments and expenses. The other aspect is the actual\nvalue of such a change and this is known through the present value of all the future payments\n\n\n## that are going to occur.\n\n\n## For example, consider a loan of Rs. 3 lakh that has to be repaid over the next 3 years at an\ninterest rate of 7 per cent when the rest is monthly. In this case the existing EMI would come\nto Rs. 9,263. If the period of the loan is extended to 5 years then the payment periods go from\n36 to 60 and this will bring down the EMI to Rs 5,940. The entire flow of Rs 5,940 is nothing\nbut the cash flow whose present value will be equal to the loan amount.\n\n\n## This is calculated by using the PMT function =PMT(0.07/12,36,-300000,,)\n\n\n## PMT=9263\n\n\n## This kind of calculation can be done for any situation wherein the amounts are adjusted so\nthat the present value for the lender remains the same. There can be cases where the lender\n\n\n## 80\n\n\n<!-- Page 81 -->\n\n\n# takes a haircut and in this case the amount that is to be repaid would be less. In the example\nabove if the lender decides to reduce the amount to be repaid to Rs 2 lakh and the loan period\nremaining is at 3 years then the EMI would drop to Rs 6,175 which would be a real relief for\nthe borrower because they are paying less in terms of present value of the final payments.\n\n\n# =PMT(0.07/12,36,-200000,,)\n\n\n## =6,175\n\n\n## A simple reduction in the number of instalments would again mean that the borrower is going\nto pay a lesser amount in terms of present value on the loan. However, this has to be seen in\nthe light of whether the amount of the instalment has been raised. This could cancel out the\nbenefit of the lower number of instalments, so this has to be checked.\n\n\n## In some cases, the restructuring will also involve a reduction in the interest rate. When there\nis a reduction in the rate the borrower will end up saving some payments if all the other\nconditions related to the loan remain the same. For example, if the 7 per cent rate in the\nexample goes to 5 per cent then the EMI will drop from Rs 9,253 to Rs 5,994. This is a real\nsaving only if the period of repayment is not increased.\n\n\n## Sometimes an additional loan is given which will help in tackling the financial crisis and this\ncan help the repayment of the amounts on the earlier loan. The conditions of the new loan\nwill once again need to be seen in the light of the present value calculations so that this does\nnot end up putting a higher burden on the borrower.\n\n\n## The client has to ensure that they are paying the right amount under the entire restructuring\nprocess because unless they check the present value of the cash flows, they will not be able\nto know what the real situation actually is.\n\n\n## 4.11 Repayment schedules with varying interest rates\n\n\n## The repayment schedule on a loan is a significant component that is often ignored because\nall that an individual focuses on is the EMI amount. The repayment of a loan consists of two\nparts which is interest and capital repaid. There might be a specific amount paid but every\nindividual also needs to see the amount that is being repaid towards capital as well as interest\nas it will determine the amount that is outstanding on the loan.\n\n\n## The normal EMI amount is found out by the PMT function in Excel but to get a proper break\nup of how the interest and the capital are being repaid there is a need to look at more\nfunctions. This would be the PPMT function for the purpose of knowing the principal part of\nthe repayment. In this part the principal component of the EMI will be known and this will\ngive an idea of the kind of money going to repay the capital borrowed. Similarly, for the\ninterest component it is the IPMT function that has to be used.\n\n\n## 81",

Using the simple PMT function the EMI for this repayment would come to Rs.\n11,610.\n\n\n# The next part of the exercise is to see how this would be broken up into the principal and\ninterest part. In the PPMT function there is the interest rate that has to be entered along with\nthe period which is the period for which the break up has to be found. In this case if you want\nthe principal payment for the first month then 1 entered here with the total loan period of\n120 months and the loan amount would give an amount of Rs. 5,777. Using the IPMT function\nthe interest component comes to Rs. 5,833 which shows the total breakup of the entire EMI.\n\n\n## For the principal calculation for the firm EMI\n\n\n## =PPMT(0.07/12,1,120,-1000000)\n\n\n## = 5,777\n\n\n## For the interest calculation for the first EMI\n\n\n## =IPMT(0.07/12,1,120,-1000000)\n\n\n## =5,833\n\n\n## If the interest rate is lower at say 5% in the example then the total EMI drops to Rs. 10,606.\nHowever, this has a big impact on the distribution of the interest and the capital within the\nEMI. Now the capital repaid in the first instalment is Rs. 6,440 while the interest component\nis Rs. 4,166. As can be seen since the overall interest rate is lower a larger part is going towards\nthe capital repayment right from the initial EMI.\n\n\n## To contrast the situation, consider the position when the interest rate is 9 percent. In this\ncase the EMI would rise to Rs. 12,667. Now out of this amount in the first month it is just Rs.\n5,167 that goes towards the principal and the remaining Rs. 7,500 goes towards the interest\ncomponent. A higher interest rate has led to a higher total interest cost which means more\ngoes towards interest right from the first payment.\n\n\n## 4.12 Criteria to evaluate loans\n\n\n## There are multiple features of loans that differ and this need to be considered by anyone who\nwants to take a loan. The exact feature can make a huge difference as far as the final cost or\nexpense on the loan is concerned.

The rate of interest\nthat is charged is significant and a lower rate will be better than a higher rate but this is not\nenough. The method of calculation of the rate is also a factor. The interest rate has to be\ncalculated on a reducing balance method as compared to a fixed capital so that the repayment\nbenefit on the loan leads to a lower interest rate.\n- The period after which the loan is reset for interest rate changes is also critical. A very long\nperiod of say a year could mean that the benefit of some rate cuts come to the individual\nborrower very late. This could result in the outstanding amount not being affected much. In\ncase of a rising interest rate then the same thing could be a benefit as the higher rates kick in\nafter a longer time period.\n- There are different expenses involved at the time of taking a loan. This could include a\nprocessing fee or legal/other charges which can be expressed as a small percentage of the\nloan amount or a fixed sum. This will raise the cost of the loan as this is a payment that is\nadditional to the interest cost. Many times, these processing charges are waived and that can\nbe a factor that leads to some savings for the borrower.\n- The time period of the loan being offered will be a serious factor that can decide where to\ntake a loan from. There are situations when some institution offers a longer time period for\nrepayment and this could be favourable for someone who wants a longer term loan. A longer\ntime period of repayment means a higher interest outgo but for those who want to reduce\ntheir EMI the choice here could be crucial.\n- The nature of the benchmark that is available for the loan is also a factor that an individual\nhas to consider before making their decision about a loan. There are now loans linked to an\nexternal benchmark like the repo rate which is transparent. Internal bank benchmarks often\ndo not change as quickly as the changes in the rates in the economy as the transmission of\nthe rates takes place slowly. The changes can work either ways because a rising rate scenario\nwill lead to higher rates coming through quicker so this also needs to be considered before a\nfinal decision is made. Nowadays, usually, Banks show their floating rate loans rather than\nfixed rate loans because in a fixed rate loan, in case interest rates in the economy move up,\nthe margin will be an issue. In a floating rate loan, rate changes are fast and transparent.\n\n4.13 Opting for change in EMI or change in tenure for interest rate changes\n\n\n## Floating rate loans are a very popular category of loans and most long-term loans are of this\nnature. The changes in the linked benchmark to the loan will lead to a change in the interest\nrate applicable on the loan. There are two choices that come before the borrower when the\ninterest rate changes and this is to either change the EMI amount or change the time for\nwhich the loan would be repaid.\n\n\n## 83",

There is a clear working that is done when the\nloan is taken. The EMI that has been selected is usually an amount that is affordable for the\nindividual given their income and savings level. So, it is easier to deal with a situation wherein\nthis remains the same and the tenure of the loan changes it is easier to keep track of the same\namount that has to be paid rather than having this change with each change in the applicable\ninterest rate. It is also that there would be some times when the interest rate rises and if the\nEMI starts rising then this could impact the financial situation or cause distress if the loan\npayment goes higher than what is optimal.\n\n\n## There can be times when the interest rate change can be reflected in the EMI. If for example\na loan has been taken at a high interest rate and this has declined significantly then the tenure\nwould have come down quite a bit. To ensure that there is a reduction on the monthly outgo\nthere could be a onetime reduction in the EMI which would reset the entire working. In other\ncircumstances when the EMI pressure is high then such a change in interest rate can be used\nto change the EMI and keep the financial situation strong.\n\n\n## 4.14 Invest the money or pay off outstanding loan\n\n\n# Many times, the individual has some amount that they received either as a lump sum or even\nas a one-time gain or windfall. The question that arises at such a time is whether the amount\nshould be used to make an investment or to pay off an outstanding loan. There are different\nconditions that would impact the decision and some factors here would be as follows:\n\n- If there is a very high loan burden, which is a strain on the finances then the amount\nreceived can be used to pay down the loan and bring it to a comfortable level. This would\nrelieve a lot of mental pressure and while in some cases this might not be the best opportunity\nfor deployment, it could be essential for mental peace or pressure.\n- The amount that is available to repay the loan or invest also has to be seen in the context\nof both the absolute figure and a relative figure. In terms of absolute amounts, if this is quite\nhigh, then this could be significant in terms of the decision made. Hence, additional factors\nlike the interest rate on the loan and the earnings on the investment need to be considered.\nHowever, if the absolute amount is small, this might not make a big difference in terms of\nrepaying the loan if the loan amount is large. In case the amount available is a significant\nportion of the loan, then repayment could lead to a debt free situation being seen earlier.\n- The mathematical aspect of the decision would depend on two main things. What is the\ninterest rate that is being charged on the loan and what is the average earning, which would\nbe available from the investment amount going forward? In some cases, the decision is easy\nto make, as a high-cost credit card outstanding or a personal loan would see a repayment as\na better choice. When it comes to the question of earnings, then one needs to look for a\n\n\n## 32\n\n\n## 84",

The benefit of compounding would mean that a good rate of return would boost\nthe capital amount significantly, so that in some time the capital available would be high\nwhich would easily pay off the loan and still have some amount left as investment.\n\n- The asset class of the investment also has to be considered because if one is planning to\ninvest in equity then there is also an extra risk that is being taken, However, if the return here\nover the longer term comes to around say 12 percent while the loan rate is around 7 percent\nthen the better idea would be to invest. However, when there is a higher earning investment,\nthen there is also a risk element involved. This should not be forgotten. Sometimes the rates\nare not very different in the loan and the investment but still the latter is compounding, so it\ncould lead to a better return on the money some time down the line, if it sustains.\n\n\n## 4.15 Strategies to reduce debt faster\n\n\n## A large amount of debt can seem to be a big problem in terms of the amount outstanding as\nwell as the interest cost that this also brings along. The goal of many people would be to\nreduce the debt as quickly as possible. There are several strategies that can be used in this\nregard.\n\n\n## 4.15.1 Avalanche\n\n\n## The avalanche strategy for paying off debt involves looking at the various loans and\nborrowings and paying off those with the highest interest rates first. This is a logical way of\ngoing about the repayment process because the highest interest rate loans are the most\ncostly and hence this is expected to bring down the interest burden. The thought is also that\nthe lower interest rate loans will not hurt the financial situation as much, so they can be paid\noff later. The risk in such a strategy is that if the higher rate loans are less in terms of absolute\namounts, then paying off them first will not reduce the interest payment pressure as\nexpected.\n\n\n## For example, if an individual has a credit card outstanding of Rs. 30,000 (42 % interest), a\npersonal loan Rs. 1.2 lakh (21 % interest), a housing loan of Rs. 15 lakh (8% interest) and a car\nloan Rs. 1 lakh (12% interest) then the avalanche strategy will lead to repayment of the credit\ncard first followed by the personal loan and then the car loan. This will reduce high interest-\nbearing debt first followed by others.\n\n\n## 4.15.2 Snowball\n\n\n# The snowball route of repayment of debt focuses on the amount of the loan. In order to get\na sense of success in the repayment the method first starts off with the lowest debt amount\nand then moves to the higher amount that is outstanding. In the snowball method, the\n\n\n## 85",

This kind of strategy is useful to achieve a sense of\nsuccess when there are quite a few loans remaining. The exact mixture of the amounts\noutstanding and the rates could still leave the interest pressure high, if the high amount loans\nhave a higher outstanding and hence this is not preferred for the example, we took above for\ncredit card and car loan etc.\n\n\n## In the snowball strategy the goal is to pick up momentum as the next repayment occurs.\nWhen the first loan is paid off the amount saved here is sought to be mixed and rolled on to\nthe next loan repayment with the expectation that this will keep gaining in terms of amount,\nso the next higher debt becomes easier to pay. This is often used as a motivational strategy.\n\n\n## 4.15.3 Blizzard\n\n\n## The blizzard approach to repaying debt is a mixture of the avalanche and snowball methods.\nThis starts off with the snowball method, whereby the lowest amount of debt is paid off first.\nOnce this gives a motivational boost, then the next step involves switching to the avalanche\nmethod and paying off the highest interest rate debt. This method is supposed to take care\nof the risk of ending up with the highest interest rate debt in the portfolio while paying off\nthe outstanding.\n\n\n## To get the calculations correct the exact amount that is outstanding plus the interest rates on\nthe loans would need to be available. In the example above this would involve paying off the\ncredit card debt first, since it is the smallest amount and this would be followed by the\npersonal loan since now this has the highest rate and then followed by the car loan and the\nhousing loan.\n\n\n## 86",

RBI is the regulator of the banking system and the monetary\nauthority.\n\n\n## RBI\n\n\n## RBI is the central bank of India. It performs supervisory function under the guidance of the\nBoard for Financial Supervision (BFS). The primary objective of BFS is to undertake\nconsolidated supervision of the financial sector comprising Scheduled Commercial and Co-\noperative Banks, All India Financial Institutions, Local Area Banks, Small Finance Banks,\nPayments Banks, Credit Information Companies, Non-Banking Finance Companies and\nPrimary Dealers.\n\n\n## Banks\n\n\n## Banks act as an intermediary between those that have excess funds to invest and those that\nneed funds by undertaking the role of mobilizing these surplus funds by taking deposits and\nlending it on the basis of a credit evaluation done on the ability of the borrowers to pay\ninterest and return the principal. The banks also provide a secure system for settling financial\ntransactions of their customers through a system of cheques and electronic payment systems.\nApart from these primary banking activities, banks also provide third-party products and\nservices to their clients by offering advice on investments and insurance.

This is a form of unsecured lending and it takes place\nthrough a peer-to-peer lending platform. These platforms are regulated by the Reserve Bank\nof India and there are detailed guidelines in place.

In the merchant segment, the merchants\nare price takers who buy or sell currency based on the price given by the banks. The\nparticipants in the spot markets are the banks, the dealers and brokers, businesses,\ngovernment and retail customers.

The primary market enables\ncapital raising, while the secondary market provides liquidity and price discovery.\n\n\n## Securities exchanges facilitate trading at market-driven prices, ensuring fair valuation and\nliquidity. National exchanges like NSE and BSE enable electronic trading via anonymous order\nmatching. They also oversee clearing and settlement to ensure smooth transactions.\n\n\n## Clearing corporations are an important part of the entire stock exchange structure. When\nan investor transacts through a registered stock exchange, they need the confidence that\ntheir money and trades are safe. The clearing corporation has the role to ensure the\nconfirmation, settlement and delivery of transactions on the stock exchange. The clearing\ncorporation has to set up risk management systems so that there is no risk to the overall\nsystem in case some investor or member is not able to pay their dues.\n\n\n## Depositories enable a single point for electronic holding of financial assets. This includes\nequities, warrants, preference shares, mutual funds held in demat form, corporate bonds,\nmoney market instruments, government securities, securitized instruments and postal\nsavings schemes. In order for a security to be eligible to trade in the secondary markets, it\nshould be held in electronic or dematerialised form. Issuers get their securities admitted to\nthe depositories, where they are held as electronic entries against investor names, without\nany paper certificate National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) and Central Depository\nServices Ltd (CDSL) are the two depositories in India.\n\n\n## Depository participants enable investors to hold and transact in securities in the\ndematerialised form. Demat securities are held by depositories, where they are admitted\nfor dematerialisation after the issuer applies to the depository and pays a fee. Depository\nparticipants (DPs) open investor accounts, in which they hold the securities that they have\nbought in dematerialised form. Brokers and banks offer DP services to investors. DPs help\ninvestors receive and deliver securities when they trade in them. While the investor-level\naccounts in securities are held and maintained by the DP, the company enters into an\nagreement with the depository to dematerialize the securities. In other words, DPs act as\nagents of the Depositories.\n\n\n## 98",

They are also responsible for collecting\nthe benefits and rights in respect of the securities held by the client and maintaining records\nof the services provided. Custodians are usually large banks.\n\n\n## Stock brokers are registered trading members of stock exchanges. They put through the\nbuy and sell transactions of investors on stock exchanges. All secondary market transactions\non stock exchanges have to be conducted through registered brokers. Several brokers\nprovide research, analysis and recommendations about securities to buy and sell, to their\ninvestors. Brokers may also enable screen-based electronic trading of securities for their\ninvestors, or support investor orders over phone. Brokers earn a commission for their\nservices.\n\n\n## Bond market\n\n\n## There are a lot of debt issuances that are used by issuers to raise money for their businesses.\nThese also become a source of investment for investors. The part of the market where the\ndebt securities are listed and traded is known as the bond market. The different types of\nsecurities here would include bonds, debentures, government securities etc. and it provides\na place where secondary trading in these instruments takes place.\n\n\n## Derivatives market\n\n\n## A derivative is any instrument that gives exposure to another asset through it i.e. they\nderive their value out of underlying assets which could be equity/debt or commodity. The\nderivative market is where instruments like futures and options are traded. These\ninstruments allow the investor to take a leveraged exposure and thus has the scope of high\nreturns but higher losses too. It can be used effectively to hedge positions but can also\nbecome a source of speculation if the investor is not aware about the risks involved in the\ninstrument.\n\n\n## Mutual funds\n\n\n## Mutual funds have emerged as one of the biggest sources of investment choices for\ninvestors. Mutual funds collect money from multiple investors and then deploy this\naccording to the mandate in their funds. They represent a collective investment option for\ninvestors. Mutual funds have exposure to equity, debt, commodity and even international\nmarkets and hence they can be used to achieve a wide variety of goals. They play the role\nof an important intermediary who are able to channel funds from small investors in the\nsecurities market because they invest on behalf of these investors.\n\n\n## 99",

There is also the need for effective allocation and choice, considering the\nrisk appetite for the investor. This is facilitated through investment advisers, who guide\ntheir clients towards their goals through the effective creation of a portfolio of investments.\nThe investment adviser plays an important role because they enable those who do not\nunderstand the complex finance products and services to choose what is right for them.\n\n\n## Alternative Investment Funds are those that privately pool money and then deploy them\nfor investing in accordance with a defined investment policy for the benefit of its investors.\nThe investors are sophisticated investors and hence these funds cater to a segment of\ninvestors who are well versed with the technical and other aspects so are able to take a\ndecision on the kind of investment policy that they should follow. This is a growing segment\nof the Indian securities market.\n\n\n## KYC registration agencies perform a significant task in the securities market. There is a need\nto ensure that there is a proper verification of the investors who are putting their money\ninto the various investments. This is done through the KYC process and the details of this is\nmaintained by the KYC registration agency. Every time that an investor goes to transact they\nwould not need to submit the same documents and this can be verified through the details\nmaintained by the KYC registration agency. The records of the investors are maintained in\na central database on behalf of the various intermediaries which can be fetched when\nrequired. For individuals, it's called CKYC Registry and for non-individuals it's called KRA\nmaintained by various bodies such as CVL, CAMS, NDML etc.\n\n\n## Credit rating agencies\n\n\n## The actual performance and financial position of any issuer in the securities market is the\nkey for investors to determine whether they should invest or not. Normal investors do not\nhave access to the detailed financial position of the issues and in most cases might not be\nable to understand the risk that is present in these instruments. Credit rating agencies are\nthose which look at the detailed financial position of an issuer and then they give a credit\nrating about a specific issue that is being made. The rating is given in standard terms so that\nthe investor is able to know the risk element by looking at the rating.\n\n\n## Credit rating agencies have an important role to play in case of debt securities where the\ninvestor would like to know the risk of default by an issuer. A default can lead to a large loss\nand the rating agency is expected to reflect the financial situation that the issuer finds itself\nin through its ratings. Each credit rating agency has its own way of showing the various\nfinancial positions so this has to be seen by the investor in the specific context.\n\n\n## 100\n\n\n<!-- Page 101 -->\n\n\n# Investment Banks are financial entities that provide strategic advice to companies,\ngovernments and others on their capital requirements and investment decisions and arrange\nraising such funds on terms that are most suitable to the company.

A portfolio holds multiple securities). Asset management\ncompanies are permitted to offer securities (called ‘units') that represent participation in a\npool of money, which is used to create the portfolio of a mutual fund.\n\n\n## Portfolio managers do not offer any security and are not permitted to pool the money\ncollected from investors. They act on behalf of the investor in creating and managing a\nportfolio. Both asset managers and portfolio managers charge the investor a fee for their\nservices, and may engage other security market intermediaries such as brokers, registrars,\nand custodians in conducting their functions.\n\n\n## Registrar and Transfer agencies help in the process of ensuring a smooth experience for\ninvestors in their investment. There are various actions like dividend payment or voting for\nseveral issues in companies. The registrar and transfer agency has the records of the\ninvestor and they carry out the process of paying the dividend into the respective bank\naccounts or sending emails with the details for e-voting and so on. They carry out the\nbackroom work that helps in the benefits of the investment reaching the investor. In case\nof mutual funds, they also ensure that the investors can transact through them and\ncomplete their investment requirements and even update their details like email, phone\nnumber or address.\n\n\n## 5.4.3 Industry and market under IRDAI\n\n\n## IRDAI is the regulator of insurance market. The insurance market is a significant part of the\noverall financial structure that has to be developed as the economy grows. The Indian\ninsurance market consists of the life insurance segment and the general insurance segment.\nThe life insurance sector was opened to private service providers in 2001.\n\n\n# The life insurance products may be broadly categorized as the traditional products, variable\ninsurance products and the unit linked products. Traditional life insurance products include\nterm insurance, endowment policies, whole life policies and the like. Term insurance is a pure\nrisk protection product with no benefit on maturity. If the insured event occurs, in this case\nloss of life insured, then the sum assured is paid to the beneficiaries.

Individual agents are certified and licensed by IRDAI and can sell policies of life\ninsurance and general insurance companies or both. Corporate agents include institutions\nsuch as banks, and they offer the insurance products to their clients. Agents typically\nrepresent one life insurer, one general insurer and one standalone health insurance company.\nSurveyors and loss assessors are used by general insurance companies to assess a claim and\nquantum of loss. Third party administrators are used to process health insurance claims.\n\n\n## 5.3.4 Industry and markets under PFRDA\n\n\n## The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) is the regulator of the\npension market. The pension market especially the National Pension System (NPS) has been\ngrowing in India as a larger part of the population has to rely on its own savings for the\npurpose of meeting the various needs during retirement and old age.\n\n\n## A growing elderly population and a large unorganized employment market are two primary\nfactors that define the pension industry in India. Much of the Indian population is still outside\nthe formal retirement benefit cover provided by the government and its associated\norganisations, and companies covered under the Employees Provident Fund Organisation\n(EPFO) rules. The government's pension plan has moved from defined benefit structure,\nwhere all retired employees of a particular rank get the same pension with no contributions\nby the employee, to a defined contribution structure, where the employee and the employer\ncontribute to the pension fund and the pension received on retirement will depend upon the\nfund accumulated. The retirement benefits in the private sector are primarily covered by the\nEmployee Provident Fund administered and supervised by the Employee Provident Fund\nOrganisation with contributions made both by the employee and the employer. A portion of\nthe employers' contribution is earmarked to provide pension under the Employee Pension\nscheme.

As the requirement for additional funds go up, it may be necessary to source funds\nfrom a wider group of investors.\n\n\n## The primary market refers to the market where equity or debt funds are raised by\ncompanies from 'outside' investors through an offer of securities. 'Outside' investors refer\nto investors who are not associated with the promoters.\n\n\n# In primary market, investors purchase the security directly from the issuer. It is also called\nthe \"new issue market\" since these securities are issued for the first time by the company.\nThe process of expanding the ability of an issuer to raise capital from public investors, who\nmay not have been associated with the initial stages of the business, is also known as \"going\npublic.\" The issuance of securities in the primary markets expands the reach of an issuer\nand makes long-term capital available to the issuer from a larger number of investors.\n6.1.1 Functions of the Primary Market\n\n\n# The primary markets serve the following functions:\n\n- Access to wider markets and investors\n\n\n## A primary market issue enables participation of a wider group of investors. Companies\nmove away from known sources of funding that may be restrictive in terms of the amount\navailable or the terms at which capital may be made available. They may be able to raise\nthe funds they require at much more competitive terms.\n\n- Transparent Pricing Mechanism\n\n\n# Securities are issued for public subscription, at a price that is determined by the demand\nand supply conditions in the market and the perceived fundamental strengths of the issuer\nto honour their commitments. The rate of interest a debt instrument will have to offer and\nthe price at which an equity share will be purchased are dependent on the pricing\nmechanisms. For example, government securities, which are issued by RBI on behalf of the\n\n\n## 104",

Banks and institutional investors are\nthe main buyers of government securities, and they bid the rates they are willing to accept\nand the final pricing of the instrument on offer depends on the outcome of the auction. This\nenables fair pricing of securities in the primary market. Equity issuances are done through\nthe book building route, but the price range not wide. It is mostly an assessment between\nthe merchant banker and the issuer.\n\n- Ownership Diversification\n\n\n## As new subscribers of equity capital come in, the stakes of existing shareholders reduce and\nthe ownership of the business becomes more broad-based and diversified. This enables the\nseparation of ownership and management of an enterprise, where professional managers\nare brought into work in the broad interest of a large group of diverse shareholders. The\npresence of independent directors on the boards of companies, representing public\nshareholders, enhances the governance standards of companies.\n\n- Better Disclosures\n\n\n## A business that seeks to raise capital from new investors, who may not be familiar with the\nhistory and working of the enterprise, has to meet higher standards of disclosure and\ntransparency. Regulations that govern primary markets prescribe the nature and periodicity\nof disclosures that have to be made. This provides investors with relevant, accurate and\nverifiable financial and other information about the business and enables them to make\ninformed decisions for investing in the securities of those businesses.\n\n- Evaluation by Investors\n\n\n## An issuer that raises money from outside investors is evaluated by a large number of\nprospective investors. This forms another layer of scrutiny of the operations and\nperformance of the company, apart from its auditors and regulators. Publicly disclosed\nfinancial statements, reports, prospectus and other information also come up for scrutiny\nand discussion by analysts, researchers, activists, and media apart from investors.\n\n- Exit for Early Investors\n\n\n## Primary markets provide an exit option for promoters, private and other investors who\nsubscribed to the initial capital issued by the company to fund the early requirements for\ncapital. 'Early investors' who take a risk by investing in a company in the initial stages before\nit has established a record of performance and profitability are thus able to make a profit\nwhen they have the choice to sell their holdings in the primary market. A vibrant primary\nmarket is thus an incentive for such investors who invest in early-stage business with the\nintent to nurture the business to a level at which public and other investors would be\ninterested.\n\n\n## 105",

The costs and effort of\nfinding another investor(s) willing to buy the securities held is high. However, a primary\nmarket issue enables distribution of securities to a large number of investors. It is\nmandatory to list a public issue of securities on the stock exchange. This opens up the\nsecondary market where the securities can be bought and sold between investors easily in\nsmall and large quantities.\n\n- Regulatory Supervision\n\n\n## Inviting 'outside investors' for subscribing to the capital or buying securities of an issuer\ncomes under comprehensive regulatory supervision. The issue process, intermediaries\ninvolved, the disclosure norms, and every step of the primary issuance process is subject to\nregulatory provisions and supervision. The objective is to protect the interest of investors\nwho contribute capital to a business, which they may not directly control or manage. While\nthere is no assurance of return, risk, safety or security, regulatory processes are designed\nto ensure that fair procedures are used to raise capital in the primary market, adequate and\naccurate information is provided, and rights of all parties is well defined, balanced and\nprotected.\n\n\n## 6.1.2 Types of Issues\n\n\n## All primary market issues need not be public issues. The securities can be issued either\nthrough public issues or through private placement (which involves issuance of securities\nto a relatively small number of select investors).\n\n\n## Issuance of capital in the primary market can be classified under four broad heads:\n\n- Public issue\n\n\n## Securities are issued to the members of the public, and anyone eligible to invest can\nparticipate in the issue. \"Public issue\" means an Initial Public Offer (IPO) or a Further Public\nOffer (FPO). Initial public offer means an offer of specified securities by an unlisted issuer\nto the public for subscription and includes an offer for sale of specified securities to the\npublic by any existing holder of such specified securities in an unlisted issuer. ‘Further Public\nOffer' means an offer of specified securities by a listed issuer to the public for subscription\nand includes an offer for sale of specified securities to the public by any existing holders of\nsuch specified securities in a listed issuer.\n\n\n## 106",

Qualified\ninstitutional buyers include institutions such as mutual funds, foreign portfolio investor,\ninsurance company etc.\n\n- Rights and Bonus issues\n\n\n## Securities are issued to existing investors as on a specific cut-off date, enabling them to buy\nmore securities at a specific price (rights) or get an allotment of additional shares without\nany consideration (bonus).\n\n\n## 6.1.3 Types of Issuers\n\n\n## As per SEBI Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements (ICDR) Regulations, 2018, an issuer\nis a company or body corporate authorized to issue securities. Issuers must meet regulatory\neligibility criteria and fulfill obligations like interest payments on bonds or dividends on equity.\n\n- Central, State and Local Governments\n\n\n# Governments raise funds through government securities (G-Sec). Such securities are short\nterm (usually called treasury bills with original maturities of less than one year) or long term\n(usually called Government bonds or dated securities with original maturity of one year or\nmore). In India, the Central Government issues both, treasury bills and bonds or dated\nsecurities while the State Governments issue only bonds or dated securities, which are\ncalled the State Development Loans (SDLs).

The central government alone issues treasury bills\nfor different maturities such as 91 days, 182 days and 364 days.\n\n- Public Sector Units\n\n\n# Public sector units are companies registered under the Companies Act, in which the\ngovernment is the majority shareholder. These companies may make an issue of shares\nwhere the government offers a portion of the shares held by them to the public. This is\ncalled disinvestment. For example, in December 2013, Power Grid Corporation of India\nmade a share issue which comprised of 13% fresh equity offer by the company and a 4%\nstake sale by the government. These companies also issue bonds. Some of the bonds may\nprovide tax benefits to investors in the form of exemption from tax for interest earned on\nthem or to save on long-term capital gains. For example, the National Highway Authority of\nIndia (NHAI) made an issue of tax-free bonds in January 2014. The interest earned by\ninvestors on these bonds is exempt from tax. To clarify, for saving on long-term capital gains,\nit is under section 54EC of Income Tax Act, and primary issuances are generally available.\nFor tax free bonds, where the coupon (interest) is free of tax, there has not been any fresh\nprimary issuance over approx. 8 years. Tax-free bonds are available in the secondary\nmarket.\n\n- Private Sector Companies\n\n\n## For private sector companies, securities market is the principal source of funds. They raise\nfunds from the markets by issuing equity or debt securities. They can raise funds from\ndomestic and international markets. They may issue ordinary equity shares, preference\nshares and convertible instruments. Corporate bonds are issued to raise long-term debt\ncapital while commercial papers are issued to raise funds for less than one year (short-term\ndebt capital).\n\n- Banks, Financial Institutions and Non-Banking Finance Companies\n\n\n## Banks, Financial Institution and Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCS) raise funds by\nissuing equity shares, preference shares, bonds, convertible bonds, commercial paper,\ncertificates of deposits and securitized paper. Deposit taking institutions such as banks have\naccess to low-cost funds from the public and therefore are not dependent too much on the\nsecurities markets. However, financial institutions and NBFCs raise short term and long-\nterm capital through the issue of securities. They have access to domestic and international\nmarkets.\n\n\n## 108",

REIT invest in\nreal estate while InvIT do so in infrastructure projects. The issue shall be managed by\nmerchant bankers appointed for the purpose.

The proceeds from the IPO go to\nthe existing shareholders who are selling the shares and not to the company. The holding\nof the existing shareholders in the share capital of the company will reduce.\n\n\n## The disinvestment of shares by the government in PSUs is an example of an offer for sale.\nThe government offers a portion of its shares to the public in an IPO. The proceeds collected\ngo to the government which is selling the shares and not to the company. There will be no\nchange in the share capital of the company. However, there will be a change in the list of\nshareholders as new investors buy the shares and a reduction in the government's holding\nin the company.\n\n\n## An IPO may also be a combination of an offer for sale and a fresh issue of shares by the\nissuing company.\n\n- Further Public Offer\n\n\n## A Further public offer is made by an issuer that has already made an IPO in the past and\nnow makes a further issue of securities to the public. When a company wants additional\ncapital for growth or to redo its capital structure by retiring debt, it raises equity capital\nthrough a fresh issue of capital in a follow-on public offer. A further public offer may also\nbe through an offer for sale. This usually happens when it is necessary to increase the public\nshareholding to meet the requirements laid down in the listing agreement between the\ncompany and the stock exchange. Or promoters may dilute their holdings in the company\nafter the lock-in imposed at the time of the IPO is over.\n\n\n## 110\n\n\n<!-- Page 111 -->\n\n\n# 6.1.6 Pricing a Public Issue of Shares\n\n\n# SEBI's Regulations allow an issuer to decide the price at which the shares will be allotted to\ninvestors in a public issue. This can either be fixed by the issuer in consultation with the\nmanagers of the issue or it can be determined by a process of bidding by investors. Based\non the method used to determine the price, a public issue can be categorized as:\n\n- Fixed Price Issue\n\n\n## In a fixed price issue of shares to the public, the company in consultation with the lead\nmanager (who is the merchant banker in-charge of the issue) would decide on the price at\nwhich the shares will be issued. The company justifies the price based on the expected\nperformance of the company and the price of shares of comparable companies in the\nmarket. This information is made available to the investors when the issue is announced so\nthat investors know the price at which the shares will be allotted to them at the time of\nmaking the application.\n\n- Book Built Issue\n\n\n## The objective of a book building process is to identify the price that the market is willing to\npay for the securities being issued by the company. The company and its issue managers\nwill specify either a floor price (base price) or a price band (price range starting from floor\nprice to 20% above it) within which investors can bid³. When the issue opens, investors will\nput in bid applications specifying the price and the number of securities (or total amount)\nbid at that price. The price bid should be above the floor price or within the price band, as\napplicable. Retail investors can revise the bids in the period when the issue is open. The\nissuer, in consultation with the book running lead manager will decide on the cut-off price\nwhich is the price at which the issue gets subscribed. All allottees who bid at or above the\ncut-off price are successful bidders and are eligible for allotment in the respective\ncategories.\n\n\n# For example, a company wants to issue 5000 shares through a book-built offer within a price\nband of Rs 120 to Rs 144. Bids are received as follows:\n\n\n## 3https://www.nseindia.com/products-services/initial-public-offerings-faqs\n\n\n## 111",

They are also subject to RBI regulations as\nregards issues to non-resident investors and receipt of money from abroad.\n\n\n# The regulations cover the eligibility of a company to make a public issue in terms of net-worth\nand track record of profitability, the process of making the issue and the timelines to be\nadhered to and the usage of the funds raised from the public. A public issue of shares may be\ngraded by an agency and the grading received is disclosed to the public.

This document is called a prospectus. A draft\nprospectus in the specified format is first filed with SEBI for comments and approval. The\nmodifications, if any, are incorporated before the final prospectus is filed with the Registrar\nof Companies, SEBI and the stock exchange where the shares are to be listed. The pricing of\na public issue may be decided by the issuing company in consultation with the lead managers\nof the issue in a fixed price offer, or through a bidding process once the offer is open.\n\n\n## 6.1.8 Applying to a Public Issue5\n\n\n## The prospectus or offer document lays down the process of applying to a public issue of\nsecurities. Information of a forthcoming public issue is typically available from the\nmandatory advertisements that the company will have to issue and from the coverage that\nIPOs get in the press. The soft copies of the offer document are available on SEBI's website\nand on the websites of the lead manager to the issue.\n\n\n## A public issue is open for subscription during a limited period as specified above. The date\non which the issue will open for subscription and the earliest closing date are mentioned in\nthe announcements about the issue. Investors have to make their application during this\nperiod.\n\n\n## Applications made in a public issue must be made only using the ASBA (Application\nSupported by Blocked Amount) facility. ASBA is an application for subscription to an issue\ncontaining an authorization to the investors' bank to block the application money in the\nbank account and release funds only on allotment.\n\n\n## SEBI has introduced the use of Unified Payment Interface (UPI) with facility of blocking\nFunds (ASBA facility), as a new payment mechanism for retail investor applications\nsubmitted through intermediaries.\n\n\n## In a book-built offer investors must place bids for the minimum bid lot specified by the\nissuer so that the minimum application value adheres to the SEBI prescribed range of\nRs.10,000 to Rs. 15,000. Investors can either specify the bidding price or they may choose\nto bid at the cut-off. Bidding at the cut-off implies that the price they would accept is the\nprice determined by the bidding process.\n\n\n## 5https://www.sebi.gov.in/sebi_data/faqfiles/jan-2017/1485857575075.pdf\n\n\n## 113",

The company files an offer document with SEBI\nand the Registrar of Companies which gives all the material information of the issue as\nrequired under Companies Act 1956/20136 and SEBI Regulations. The debentures issued\nunder a public offer have to mandatorily be listed on a stock exchange. The company is\nrequired to obtain credit rating from at least one credit rating agency and the rating has to\nbe disclosed in the offer document. If the rating has been obtained from more than one\nrating agency, all the ratings are required to be disclosed.\n\n\n## Debenture trustees are required to be appointed to oversee the interests of the investors.\nTrustees are banks and financial institutions who are registered with SEBI to act as\ndebenture trustees.

There\nis a specific ratio in which the shares are offered to the investor.\n\n\n# The RE has a separate (International Securities Identification Number) ISIN number so these\ncan be traded on the stock exchanges. The investor who does not want to take on the rights\nissue can sell the RE at the prevailing market price. The investor can thus trade in the RE just\nlike normal shares.\n\n\n## The application for a rights issue has to be only through Applications Supported by Blocked\nAmount (ASBA). The procedure for a rights issue has an application form that is available for\ninvestor, which now would have the details of the RE.\n\n\n## 6.2 Role and Function of the Secondary Market\n\n\n## The secondary market is where securities once issued are bought and sold between\ninvestors. The instruments traded in secondary markets include securities issued in the\nprimary market as well as those that were not issued in the primary market, such as\nprivately placed debt or equity securities and derivatives of primary securities created and\ntraded by financial intermediaries.\n\n\n## Transactions in the secondary market do not result in additional capital to the issuer as\nfunds are only exchanged between investors. The role of the secondary market is to support\nthe capital raising function of the primary market by providing liquidity, price identification,\ninformation signalling and acting as a barometer of economic activity.\n\n\n## 6.2.1 Functions of Secondary Markets\n\n- Liquidity\n\n\n## Secondary markets provide liquidity and marketability to existing securities. If an investor\nwants to sell off equity shares or debentures purchased earlier, it can be done in the\nsecondary market. Alternately, if new investors want to buy equity shares or debentures\nthat have been previously issued, sellers can be found in the secondary market. Investors\ncan exit or enter any listed security by transacting in the secondary markets.\n\n\n## A liquid market enables investors to buy perpetual securities such as equity that are not\nredeemed by the issuer or long-term instruments maturing far into the future without the\nrisk of the funds getting blocked. Where investors invest in risky securities whose future\nperformance is unknown, a secondary market enables exit if the expectations are not met.\nInvestors can sell their securities at a low cost and in a short span of time, if there is a liquid\nsecondary market for the securities that they hold. The sellers transfer ownership to buyers\nwho are willing to buy the security at the price prevailing in the secondary market.\n\n\n## 115",

The price at which investors\nundertake buy or sell transaction reflects the individual assessment of investors about the\nfundamental worth of the security. The collective opinions of various investors are reflected\nin the real time trading information provided by the exchange. The continuous flow of price\ndata allows investors to identify the market price of equity shares. If an issuing company is\nperforming well or has good future prospects, many investors may try to buy its shares. As\ndemand rises, the market price of the share will tend to go up. The rising price is a signal of\nexpected good performance in the future. If an issuing company is performing poorly or is\nlikely to face some operating distress in the future, there are likely to be more sellers than\nbuyers of its shares. This will push down its market price. Market prices change\ncontinuously, and they reflect market judgement about the security.\n\n\n## Market valuation benefits issuers when they have to raise further capital from the market,\nby giving an indication of the price at which new capital could be issued. For example,\nconsider a company with equity shares of face value of Rs.10, which are being traded for\naround Rs.100 in the market. If the company wants to raise additional capital by issuing\nfresh equity share, it could issue them at a price close to Rs.100, which is the value\ndetermined by investors in the market.\n\n- Information Signalling\n\n\n## Market prices provide instant information about issuing companies to all market\nparticipants. This information-signalling function of prices works like a continuous monitor\nof issuing companies, and in turn forces issuers to improve profitability and performance.\nEfficient markets are those in which market prices of securities reflect all available\ninformation about the security. A large number of players trying to buy and sell based on\ninformation about the listed security tend to create volatility in prices, but also efficiently\nincorporate all relevant information into the price. As new information becomes available,\nprices change to reflect it.\n\n- Indicating Economic Activity\n\n\n## Secondary market trading data is used to generate benchmark indices that are widely\ntracked in the country. A market index is generated from market prices of a representative\nbasket of equity shares. Movements in the index represent the overall market direction.\nThe S&P BSE-Sensex and the NSE-Nifty 50 are the most popularly watched indices in India.\nA stock market index is viewed as a barometer of economic performance. A sustained rise\nin key market indices indicate healthy revenues, profitability, capital investment and\nexpansion in large listed companies, which in turn implies that the economy is growing\nstrongly. A continuous decline or poor returns on indices is a signal of weakening economic\nactivity.\n\n\n## 116",

If management is inefficient, a company could end up performing below\nits potential. Market forces will push down shares prices of underperforming companies,\nleading to their undervaluation. Such companies can become takeover targets. Potential\nacquirers could acquire a significant portion of the target firm's shares in the market, take\nover its board of directors, and improve its market value by providing better governance.\nAn actual takeover need not happen; even the possibility of a takeover can be an effective\nmechanism to ensure better governance.\n\n\n## 6.2.2 Market Structure and Participants\n\n\n# The secondary market consists of the following participants:\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Market Infrastructure Institutions-stock exchanges, clearing corporations and\ndepositories.\n\n\n## Investors-individuals, institutions and foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) that buy and sell\nsecurities.

The market cap of a company measures the\nmarket value of its share capital. Traded stocks are often categorised by market\ncapitalisation.\n\n\n## Blue-chip stocks represent the largest companies by market capitalisation. These stocks\nhave a high level of liquidity. These are also known as large cap stocks.\n\n\n## Mid cap stocks refer to those companies which enjoy a good level of liquidity but are\nmedium in terms of size.\n\n\n## Small cap stocks are those stocks that are smaller in size and therefore do not enjoy much\nliquidity.\n\n\n## Market cap is also used as an indicator of the size and importance of the stock market of a\ncountry. The ratio of market cap to GDP of a country is one such measure.\n\n- Market Turnover\n\n\n## 117",

The turnover ratio for the market as a whole is\ncomputed as the ratio of turnover in rupees to market capitalisation. Higher is the liquidity\nin the market, higher will be the turnover ratio.\n\n\n## Trading activity is measured in two ways-traded values in rupees and traded volume in\nnumber of trades. It is usual for large cap stocks to have a high traded value.\n\n- Market Indices\n\n\n## A market index tracks the market movement by using the prices of a small number of shares\nchosen as a representative sample. Most leading indices are weighted by market\ncapitalisation to take into account the fact that more the number of shares issued, greater\nthe number of portfolios in which they may be held. Stocks included in an index are also\nquite liquid, making it possible for investors to replicate the index at a low cost. Narrow\nindices are usually made up of the most actively traded equity shares in that exchange.\nThere are other indices to track sectors or different market cap categories. The most widely\ntracked indices in India are the S&P BSE Sensex and NSE's Nifty 50.\n\n\n## The composition of stocks in the index is reviewed and modified from time to time to keep\nthe index representative of the underlying market.\n\n\n## There are also sector indices for banking, information technology, pharma, fast-moving\nconsumer goods and such other sectors, created by the exchanges to enable tracking of\nspecific sectors.\n\n\n# A stock market index has several uses:\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Indices are widely reported in the news, financial press and electronic information media\nand thus real time data on market movements is easily available to the investing public.\nThe index value is a leading indicator of overall economic or sector performance and\neffectively captures the state of financial markets at a point of time.\n\n\n## A representative index serves as a performance benchmark. The returns earned by equity\nmutual funds or other investment vehicles are often compared with the returns on the\nmarket index.\n\n\n## 6.2.4 Risk Management Systems in the Secondary Markets\n\n\n# When a large volume of trades happen on a stock exchange it makes the market very liquid,\nefficient and low cost.

Risk containment\nmechanisms such as maintenance of adequate capital assets by members and regular\nimposition of margin payments on trades ensure that damages through defaults are\nminimised. Exchanges thus enable two distinct functions: high liquidity in execution of\ntrades and guaranteed settlement of executed trades.\n\n- Capital Adequacy Norms\n\n\n## In order to be eligible as trading and clearing members, individual and corporate entities\nhave to meet and maintain minimum paid-up capital and net worth norms prescribed by\nthe stock exchanges and SEBI. The Capital Adequacy Requirements consists of two\ncomponents i.e. the Base Minimum Capital (BMC) and the Additional or Optional Capital\nrelated to volume of the business. BMC is the deposit given by the members of the exchange\nagainst which no exposure for trades is allowed. Additional capital is brought in over and\nabove the BMC which has to be adequate to cover all margin payments.\n\n- Margins\n\n\n## A margin is the amount of funds that one has to deposit with the clearing corporation in order\nto cover the risk of non-payment of dues or non-delivery of securities.\n\n\n# Suppose an investor purchases 100 shares of Company X at Rs.100 each on January 1, 2020.\nHe has to pay in Rs.10,000 by January 3, 2020. The risks in this transaction are that:\n\n\n## •\n\nThe buyer may not be able to bring in the required funds by the due date\n\n\n## •\n\nThe seller may not be able to deliver securities at the due date\n\n\n## In order to minimise this default risk, both buyers and sellers of equity are required to pay\na percentage of their dues upfront at the time of placing their order. This payment is known\nas margin. For example, if the margin is set at 17%, the buyer would pay Rs.1,700 in advance.\nMargins are collected from the clients by brokers when the order is placed. Stock exchanges\ncollect margins from brokers when the order is executed.\n\n- Circuit Breakers and Price Bands\n\n\n## If there is an abnormal price movement in an index, defined in percentage terms, the\nexchange can suspend trading. This is called hitting the circuit breaker.\n\n\n# The index-based market-wide circuit breaker system applies at 3 stages of the index\nmovement, either way viz. at 10%, 15% and 20%. These circuit breakers when triggered bring\nabout a coordinated trading halt in all equity and equity derivative markets nationwide. The\n\n\n## 119",

The\nclearing corporation steps in as the legal counterpart, thus eliminating counterparty risk.\nThis process is called novation. This implies that it assumes counterparty risk completely,\nby settling all trades even if the trading member defaults on pay-in or pay-out. Some of this\ncounter party risk is managed through the levy of margins. The guaranteed settlement is\nalso ensured through the Core Settlement Guarantee Fund (Core SGF).\n\n\n## The primary objective of having Core Settlement Guarantee Fund (SGF) is to guarantee the\nsettlement of trades executed in respective segments of the stock exchange (Cash, equity\nderivatives, Currency Derivatives). In the event of a clearing member failing to honour\nsettlement commitments, the core SGF shall be used to fund the obligations of that member\nand complete the settlement without affecting the normal settlement process.\n\n- On-line Monitoring\n\n\n# The positions and transactions of the trading members/clearing members are monitored\non a real-time basis by the stock exchanges. The on-line monitoring system is designed to\ngive alerts if members build up an abnormal sale or purchase positions or if margins are\ninadequate relative to their exposure. The clearing house/corporation can proactively carry\n\n\n## 120\n\n\n<!-- Page 121 -->\n\n\n# out a detailed check of members trading and reduce their open positions, if necessary. Any\nnews or media information that leads to unusually large price/volume movements are also\nscrutinized and investigated by surveillance officers of the stock exchange.\n\n- Price Monitoring and Action\n\n\n# On surveillance of abnormal price movements, stock exchanges can take the following actions\nto minimise volatility:\n\n\n## Imposition of special margins on scrips that have shown unusually large movements in\nprice or volume. Depending on the situation, the margins may be imposed on client-wise\nnet outstanding purchases, or sales or both.\n\n- Circuit filter limits may be reduced to keep prices under control. This will ensure that\ntrading will halt with a smaller rise in prices than usual.\n- Shifting a scrip from settlement to the trade-to-trade segment forces members to\ngive/take delivery in that scrip, and so minimises any volatility due to intra-day closing.\n- Inspection of Books\n\n\n## The stock exchange conducts an inspection of the books of trading members of each market\nsegment at least once a year. The purpose of the inspection is to check member compliance\nwith the applicable rules and regulations. Any violations observed result in disciplinary\naction by the Exchange.\n\n\n# 6.3 Corporate Actions\n\n\n## A company conducts several actions, apart from those related to its business, that have a\ndirect implication for the shareholder. These include sharing of surplus with the shareholders\nin the form of dividend or bonus, changes in the capital structure through the issue of rights\nshares, buy backs, mergers and acquisitions and delisting. In a company that has made a\npublic issue of shares the interest of the small investors have to be particularly protected. All\ncorporate actions are regulated by the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, the relevant\nregulations of SEBI and the terms of the listing agreement entered into with the stock\nexchange. All corporate actions therefore require notice to be given to the regulators as\nspecified in the applicable clauses.\n\n\n## Corporate benefits and actions apply to all investors holding shares in physical form or in\ndematerialized form. In order to determine this, the company announces a record date or\nbook closure period and investors whose names appear on the records on this date are\neligible shareholders to receive notice of the action and entitled to benefit from it.\n\n\n# 6.3.1 Rights Issue\n\n\n## 121",

For example, a company may have 10 lakhs shares of Rs.10 each, amounting to an\nissued and paid-up capital of Rs. 1 crore. If it issues another 10 lakhs shares, to increase its\ncapital, the proportion held by existing shareholders will come down by half, as the issued\nand paid-up capital has doubled. This is called as dilution of holdings. To prevent this the\nCompany's Act requires that a company which wants to raise more capital through an issue\nof shares must first offer them to the existing shareholders. Such an offer of shares is called\na rights issue.\n\n\n## The rights shares are offered to the existing investors in a proportion as approved by the\nboard of a company. For example, the company may choose to issue rights at 1 for 1, to\ndouble its capital. This means each existing shareholders will get one equity share for every\none equity share that they already hold. The issued and paid-up capital will double, but\nproportionate holdings will not change. Ratio of rights issues need not always be one. They\ncan be 1:2, 2:3, and 2:5 and so on, depending on the decision of the board of the company.\n\n\n# A rights issue of shares must follow all SEBI's regulation on issue of shares. A listed company\nmaking a rights issue shall fix a record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders\nfor the rights issue. The company must issue a letter of offer giving details of the issue\nincluding the purpose for which funds are being raised. The draft letter of offer must be\nfiled with SEBI. The rights entitlements are credited to the demat account of the investor.\n6.3.2 Bonus Issue\n\n\n## A bonus issue of shares is made to the existing shareholders of a company without any\nconsideration from them. The entitlement to the bonus shares depends upon the existing\nshareholding of the investor. A bonus issue in the ratio 1:3 entitles the shareholder to 1\nbonus share for every 3 held. The company makes the bonus issue out of its free reserves\nbuilt from genuine profits. A company cannot make a bonus issue if it has defaulted on the\npayment of interest or principal on any debt securities issued or any fixed deposit raised.\n\n\n## A company has to get the approval of its board of directors for a bonus issue. In some cases,\nthe shareholders of the company also need to approve the issue.\n\n\n## 6.3.3 Dividend\n\n\n## Dividends are the share of the profits of the company received by its shareholders. A company\nmay declare interim dividends during the financial year and final dividend at the end of the\nyear. A company is allowed to declare dividends out of the profit and loss account and the\nprofits of the year in which the dividends are to be paid.\n\n\n## 122",

A company which\nhas failed to redeem its preference shares is prohibited from declaring dividends. Dividends\ncannot be declared out of the share premium account, revaluation reserve or capital\nredemption reserve, among others.\n\nSEBI has mandated that listed companies shall declare dividends on a per share basis.\n\n\n# 6.3.4 Stock Split\n\n\n## A stock split is a corporate action where the face value of the existing shares is reduced in a\ndefined ratio. A stock split of 1:5 splits an existing share into 5 shares. Accordingly, the face\nvalue of the shares will go down to 1/5th the original face value. For example, if an investor\nholds 100 shares of a company with a face value of Rs.10 each, a stock split in the ratio of 1:5\nwill increase the number of shares held by the investor to 500 but the face value of each share\nwill go down to Rs.2. From the company's perspective, there is no change in its share capital\nsince an increase in the number of shares is offset by a fall in the face value.\n\n\n## The value of the investor's holding will not change. For example, if the shares were trading at\na price of Rs.1,000 per share prior to the split, post the split the price is likely to come down\nto Rs.200 per share. The value of the investor's holding was Rs.100,000 (100 shares x\nRs.1,000). Post the split the value will remain at Rs.100,000 (500 shares x Rs.200). The actual\nprice will be around Rs.200 and will depend on market factors of demand and supply.\n\n\n## Companies consider a share split if the price of the shares in the secondary markets is seen to\nbe very high and therefore restricting the participation by investors. A share split leads to\ngreater liquidity in the market.\n\n\n# 6.3.5 Share Buyback\n\n\n## A company may buy back its shares listed on a stock exchange from the investors out of the\nreserves and surplus available with the company. The shares bought back are extinguished by\nthe company and leads to a reduction in its share capital. A share buyback is used by\ncompanies to increase the Earning Per Share (EPS) and thereby support the share price in the\nmarket. Surplus cash with the company for which there is no productive use, is used to\nrestructure the capital of the company. To be eligible for a share buyback a company should\nnot have defaulted on the payment of interest or principal on debentures, fixed deposits,\nredemption of preference shares or payment of dividend declared or payment of interest on\nany outstanding term loan.\n\n\n## 6.3.6 Delisting of Shares\n\n\n# Delisting of shares refers to the permanent removal of the shares of a company from being\nlisted on a stock exchange.

Broadly, investments can be classified into\nfinancial or non-financial investments. Non-financial investments include real estate, gold,\ncommodities etc. Financial Investments are exchange of cash flows for a period of time.\nFinancial instruments are essentially claims on future cash flows. On the basis of claims on\nthe cash flows, there are two generic types of financial instruments: debt and equity. Financial\ninvestments can also be classified on the basis of the markets they trade: public versus private\nmarkets. Another popular way of classifying the financial opportunities is on the basis of their\nmaturity profile: Capital market versus money market.\n\n\n## 7.2 Equity\n\n\n## Investment characteristics and role\n\n\n## Equity shares represent ownership in a company, giving holders profit-sharing and voting\nrights. Shareholders are residual claimants, receiving profits after other obligations are met.\nEquity investments offer returns through dividends and capital appreciation. Over the long\nterm, equities provide time diversification benefits, reducing risk fluctuations and improving\nrisk-adjusted returns.\n\n\n# In addition to equity shares, companies may also issue preference shares. Preference shares\nrank above equity shares with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of\ncompany's net assets in case of liquidation. However, preference shares do not generally have\nvoting rights like equity shares, unless stated otherwise. Preference shares share some\ncharacteristics with debt securities like fixed dividend payment. Similar to equity share,\n\n\n## 127",

  {
    "page_content": "<!-- Page 128 -->\n\n\n# preference shares can be perpetual. Dividends on preference shares can be cumulative, non-\ncumulative, participating, non-participating or some combination thereof (i.e., cumulative\nparticipating, cumulative non-participating, non-cumulative participating, non-cumulative\nnon-participating). In case preference stock is cumulative, the unpaid dividends would\naccumulate to be paid in full at a later time, whereas in non-cumulative stocks the unpaid or\nomitted dividend does not get paid.\n\n\n## A non-participating preference share is one in which a dividend is paid, usually at a fixed rate,\nand not determined by a company's earnings. Participating preference share gives the holder\nthe right to receive specified dividends plus an additional dividend based on some pre-\nspecified conditions. Participating preference shares can also have liquidation preferences\nupon a liquidation event.\n\n\n## Preference shares can also be convertible. Convertible preference shares entitle shareholders\nto convert their preference shares into a specified number of equity shares. Since preference\nshares carry some characteristics of equity share and at the same time some of the debt\nsecurities, they are referred to as hybrid or blended securities.\n\n\n## Equity shareholders participate in company governance through voting rights, typically\nfollowing the 'one share, one vote' principle. Some companies issue shares with Differential\nVoting Rights (DVRs), which may offer superior or inferior voting rights or differential\ndividends. While common in the West, DVRs have seen limited adoption in India despite being\npermitted since 2000. Tata Motors was among the first to issue DVRs in 2008, offering 1/10th\nvoting rights and a 5% higher dividend. Other companies like Pantaloons Retail, Gujarat NRE\nCoke, and Jain Irrigation Systems have also issued DVRs.\n\n\n# 7.3 Fixed Income\n\n\n# Debt instruments, also called fixed income instruments, are contracts containing a promise\nto pay a stream of cashflows during the term of the contract to the investors. The debt\ncontract can be transferable, a feature specified in the contract that permits its sale to\nanother investor, or non-transferable, which prohibits sale to another party. Generally, the\npromised cash flow of a debt instrument is a periodic payment, but the parties involved can\nnegotiate almost any sort of cash flow arrangement. A debt contract also establishes the\nfinancial requirements and restrictions that the borrower must meet and the rights of the\nholder of the debt instruments if the borrower defaults. Debt securities are issued by\ncompanies, municipalities, states and sovereign governments to raise money to finance a\nvariety of projects and activities. Debt instruments can further be classified on the basis of\nissuer into government debt securities and corporate debt securities where the issuer is a\n\n\n## 128",

Government securities form the largest component of debt market\nin India as well as world over.\n\n\n# Government versus corporate Debt Securities\n\n\n# A Government Security (G-Sec) is a tradeable instrument issued by the Central Government\nor the State Governments. It acknowledges the Government's debt obligation. Such securities\nare short term (usually called treasury bills, with original maturities of less than one year) or\nlong term (usually called Government bonds or dated securities with original maturity of more\nthan one year). In India, the Central Government issues both treasury bills and bonds or dated\nsecurities while the State Governments issue only bonds or dated securities, which are called\nthe State Development Loans (SDLs). G-Secs carry practically no risk of default and, hence,\nare called risk-free gilt-edged instruments.\n\n\n## A key source of funds for corporates is debt financing. Companies issue debt securities of\nvarious maturity profile. Many of these corporate debt papers are listed on stock exchanges.\nHowever, a bigger component of corporate borrowings lies in the unlisted space. Corporate\nfixed income securities pay higher interest rates than the government securities due to\ndefault risk. The difference between the yield on a government security and the corporate\nsecurity for the same maturity is called \"credit spread”. Higher the probability of default\ngreater would be the credit spread. Credit Spread could also be understood as the \"Risk\nPremium\" which the companies are paying to raise the debt, or the investors are charging for\nbearing default risk.\n\n\n## High Yield versus Investment Grade\n\n\n## The probability of default on a fixed income paper is captured by ratings given by rating\nagencies.\n\nTable 7.1 gives the rating symbols given by rating agencies registered with SEBI.\n\n\n## 7.1 Rating Scale and description\n\n\n# Rating\nААА\n\n\n## Description\n\n\n## (Highest Safety)\n\n\n## AA\n\n\n## (High Safety)\n\n\n## A\n\n\n## (Adequate Safety)\n\n\n## Instruments with this rating are considered to have\nthe highest degree of safety regarding timely servicing\nof financial obligations.

The convention in the market is to classify bonds with rating BBB and above as\ninvestment grade and bonds below the BBB as high yield or junk bonds. Many institutional\ninvestors are prohibited from investing in junk bonds as they involve high default risk.\n\n\n## 7.4 Commodities\n\n\n# Investments in soft commodities which are grown like corn, wheat, soybean, soybean oil,\nsugar and also used as inputs in the production of other goods; and hard commodities which\nare mined like gold, silver, oil, copper and aluminium are other investment avenues available\nto investors. Soft commodities are perishable hence they exhibit high volatility in their prices.\nThese commodities are subject to higher business cycle risk as their prices are determined by\nthe demand and supply of the end products in which they are consumed. Soft commodities\nhistorically have shown low correlation to stocks and bonds. Hence, they provide benefits of\nrisk diversification when held in a portfolio along with stock and bonds. Prediction of weather\nis an important factor while investing in soft commodities. Exposure to these commodities\ncan be taken through derivative contracts like forwards or futures. Hence investors must\ncarefully understand the risk involved in the same. Prices of hard commodities are\ndetermined by the interaction between global demand and supply. Hard commodities like\ngold and silver have been the investment avenues for centuries, as reserve assets. Due to its\n\n7a technical term used to measure movement between two variables. The benefits of diversification rests on correlation\nbetween investments. Lower the correlation between investments, higher the benefits of diversification i.e. reduction in risk.\n\n\n## 130\n\n\n<!-- Page 131 -->\n\n\n# global acceptability gold has acquired the status safe haven asset. It is viewed as an attractive\ninvestment in times of economic uncertainty and geopolitical crisis. Gold has shown\ndiversification benefits historically. Unlike most of the financial investment commodities do\nnot generate any current income and the investor in these commodities would have to count\nonly on capital appreciation.\n\n\n# 7.5 Real Estate\n\n\n## Real estate is a significant asset class. It has been a significant driver of economic growth. It\noffers significant diversification opportunities. It has been historically viewed as a good\ninflation hedge. Investors can invest into real estate with capital appreciation as an\ninvestment objective as well as to generate regular income by way of rents. It is usually a long-\nterm investment. Real estate is classified into two sub-classes: commercial real estate or\nresidential real estate. It can be further broken down into terms of tier I, tier II and tier III\ncities. Real estate investments often involve large commitments. Real estate funds or Real\nEstate Investment Trusts (REIT) have emerged as a good option to enable investors to take\nexposure to this asset class with smaller outflow commitments.\n\n\n## 7.6 Structured products\n\n\n## Structured products are customized and sophisticated investments. They provide investors\nrisk-adjusted exposure to traditional investments or to assets that are otherwise difficult to\nobtain. Structured products greatly use derivatives to create desired risk exposures. Many\nstructured products are designed to provide risk-adjusted returns that are linked to equity\nmarket indices, sector indices, basket of stocks with some particular theme, currencies,\ninterest rates, commodity or a basket of commodities. Structured products can be designed\nfor a short term or for long terms. The terms can be customized to meet the requirements of\nthe investing community. These products require investments of a larger denomination. They\nmay offer investment protection from 0% to 100% and/or attractive yields. The performance\nof the structured product is largely driven by the underlying strategy subject to market\nconditions. Hence, they must not be taken as capital protection or guaranteed or assured\nreturn products. The most common usage of structured products is Market Linked\nDebentures (MLDs).\n\n\n# 7.7 Distressed Securities\n\n\n# Distressed securities are the securities of the companies that are in financial distress or near\nbankruptcy. Investors can make investments in the equity and debt securities of publicly\ntraded companies. These may be available at huge discounts, however investments in them\nrequire higher skills and greater experience in business valuation than regular securities.\nThese securities can be considered from the perspective of diversification of risk by evolved\ninvestors with understanding and appetite for risk. These securities are also referred to as\n‘fallen angels' and many types of funds and institutional investors are prohibited from holding\nthese securities because of the high risk involved.

There\nare PMS and AIF products on distressed securities.\n\n\n# 7.8 Other investment opportunities\n\n\n# Art and paintings and rare collectibles are emerging as an attractive long-term investment\nopportunity. This category of investment has been generating moderate return in the long\nterm. It also has low correlation with financial investment like equities and bonds. Hence it\nprovides a good risk diversification benefit. However, these are big ticket investments. Also,\nart is not a standard investment product as each work is unique. The market for the same is\nunregulated. These investments do not provide any income and just like gold, capital\nappreciation is the only way of reward. In terms of liquidity, this category is relatively more\nilliquid. To make the rewarding investment decisions, specialized knowledge in arts is more\ncrucial than in traditional financial assets due to higher levels of information asymmetry and\nadverse selection problems. There are art and painting based investment funds. Investors can\ntake exposure through these funds.\n\n\n## Investments are also permitted abroad under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS)\nwherein an individual can invest upto $ 250,000 abroad every year. This route allows for\ngeographical as well as currency diversification and also opens up several new choices for\ninvestors.\n\n\n## 7.9 Channels for making investments\n\n\n## Investors can invest in any of the investment opportunities discussed above directly or\nthrough intermediary providing various managed portfolio solutions.\n\n\n## Direct investments\n\n\n## Direct investments are when investors buy the securities issued by companies and\ngovernment bodies and commodities like gold and silver. Investors can buy gold or silver\ndirectly from the sellers or dealers. In case of financial securities, a few fee-based financial\nintermediaries aid investors buy or sell investments viz. brokers, depositories, advisors etc.,\nfor fees or commission.\n\n\n## Understanding the role of RIAs\n\n\n## Investors can take the advice from SEBI Registered Investment Adviser (RIA). As per the SEBI\nRegulation relating to RIA which came in the year 2013, only qualified professionals who are\nlicensed by SEBI as Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs) can act as ‘advisers'. These advisers\nare paid fees by the investors who hire them for investment advice. After this regulation, the\ndistributors of financial products like mutual fund distributors, share brokers and insurance\nagents who would earlier act as investment advisers, can no longer claim the title. These\nadvisers, like other fee-based professionals, are only accountable to their investors. They are\nrequired to follow a strict code of conduct and offer advice in the investors' best interests.\n\n\n## 132",

Advisers do basic risk profiling,\nassess the needs and requirements of the investors, understand their financial health and\ndevelop ‘financial plans'. They help in inculcating a sense of discipline in investors. Thus\nInvestment advisers can help investors create an optimum investment portfolio and help\nthem in making rational investment decisions.\n\n\n# Investments through managed portfolios\n\n\n## Alternatively, investors can invest through investment vehicles which pool money from\ninvestors and invest in a variety of securities and other investments on their behalf. In other\nwords, investors make indirect investments. These investment vehicles are professionally\nmanaged. Through these managed portfolios they can avail the professional expertise at\nmuch lower costs.\n\n\n## The following are examples of managed portfolio solutions available to investors in India:\n\n- Mutual Funds (MFS)\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs)\n\n- Portfolio Managers (PMs)\n- Collective Investment Schemes (CISS)\n\n\n## Compare and Contrast between Mutual Funds, Alternate Investment Funds and Portfolio\nManagers\n\n\n## Mutual Funds, Alternate Investment Funds (AIFs) and Portfolio Managers (PMs) are managed\nportfolios. All three provide indirect ways of investing in securities and other investments to\ninvestors. All three are regulated by SEBI. However, Mutual funds are more stringently\nregulated compared to AIF and PMS as mutual funds cater to retail investors. In case of AIF,\nthe minimum amount required for investment is Rs. one crore and in case of PMS it is Rs. Fifty\nlakhs. AIF and PMS cater to institutional and high net worth investors. These investors are\nexpected to understand complex investment strategy and risks involved. MFs are subjected\nto high-touch regulation whereas PMSs and AIFs have light-touch regulation, due to the\ndifferent level of understanding of risks by investors. The investment restrictions of PMS and\nAIF are also relatively less compared to mutual funds. So though, there are some similarities\nbetween them, there are important differences too. AIFs and PMS are popularly referred to\nas rich man's mutual fund.\n\n\n## 133",

Equity securities are issued by companies providing ownership to\nthe investor in their company, and Debt securities are issued by companies providing the\nrights of a lender to the investor. The features of both these securities differ due to the\ninherent difference in the claim of the investors on the company.\n\n\n## Equity investors, also known as shareholders, have residual claim³ in the business. Because\nthey are the owners of the company and not lenders, the company which issues equity\nsecurities, is not contractually obligated to repay the amount it receives from the\nshareholders. It is also not contractually obligated to make periodic payments to shareholders\nfor the use of their funds, like interest payments in the case of lenders. Equity investors get\nvoting rights. When equity investors own a sizable amount of shares in a company, they get\nan opportunity to participate in the management of the business.\n\n\n## Investors who purchase equity shares look for capital appreciation and dividend income.\nThere is no assurance of either by the company to the equity investor. While dividend\npayment depends on the profitability of the company, capital appreciation depends on the\nconditions of the stock market. Because all residual benefits of deploying capital in a business\ngo to the equity investor, It is usually expected that the return to equity investors should be\nhigher than that of the debt investors (lenders).\n\n\n# Choosing between equity and debt is a trade-off for investors. Investors desiring lower risk\nchoose debt, at the cost of lower but stable returns. However, if they seek a higher returns\nthey choose equity investment, but they may not be able to earn it without taking on the\n\nClaim on the company's net assets, i.e. the value of assets after all liabilities have been paid.\n\n\n## 134",

Most investors tend to allocate their capital between\nthese two choices, depending on their expected return, their investing time period, their risk\nappetite and their needs.\n\n\n# 8.2 Diversification of risk through equity instruments - Cross sectional versus time series\nEquity is inherently riskier compared to bonds and many other asset classes. However, there\nare ways to mitigate the risks in stocks. The most meaningful way to risk reduction is through\ndiversification - both on cross sectional (i.e. across business sectors and industries) as well as\non time series basis (i.e. across various time periods).\n\n\n## Empirical research has demonstrated that a significant portion of risk can be reduced through\ndiversification. Conceptually, it is achieved due to the relatively less correlated behaviour of\nvarious business sectors which underlie each equity investment. This is what the old adage\n'Don't put all your eggs in one basket' means.\n\n\n## Cross sectional risk diversification is reducing risk by holding equities in many different kinds\nof businesses at a point in time and also across various geographies of the world.\n\n\n## Reaping the benefits of time diversification requires investing in equities for a long period of\ntime. The belief is that bad times will get cancelled out by good times. This is why \"time in the\nmarket” is suggested for equity investment as against “timing the market”.\n\n\n## Underlying the word 'diversification' is the concept of business cycles and counter-cyclical\nbusinesses, and the phenomenon of lag and lead between the behaviour of investments\nreturns and countries' economic performance.\n\n\n# In the Figure 8.1, a business cycle is shown as a dark line. Some businesses may be at peak\nwhen the business cycle is in its trough, as shown by the broken line. These products or\nbusinesses are called 'counter-cyclical' or defensive businesses. Businesses that do better in\na recession are called 'recession-proof' businesses. Some products, sectors or countries come\nout of a recession faster than others (these are called as leading sectors); other products,\nsectors or countries may go into recession later than others (these are called lagging sectors).\nFigure 8.1 Counter-cyclical products\n\n\n## Counter\n\n\n# xxx =\n\n\n## 8.3 Risks of equity investments\n\n\n## Cyclical\nProducts\n\n\n# Equities are often regarded as riskier than other asset classes.

Market risks cannot be diversified away, though it can be hedged.\n\n\n## 8.3.2. Sector specific risk\n\n\n## Risks due to sector specific factors are not part of market risks. These risks can be diversified\naway by investing in different business sectors. Sector specific risks arise due to factors that\naffect the performance of businesses in a particular sector/industry. Factors affecting certain\nsectors might not impact certain other sectors. Such risks are also called \"idiosyncratic risks\".\nSay for instance there are restrictions on the movement of international tourists, the airline\nindustry and hospitality industry are going to be affected. But industries and business sectors\ndependent on domestic customers are not affected by such restrictions.\n\n\n## 8.3.3. Company specific risk\n\n\n## Risks arising due to company specific factors are also non-market risks. These risks can also\nbe diversified away by investing in different companies. Company specific risk arises due to\nfactors that affect only the performance of a single company and other firms might not be\naffected by them. Though, overall, the airline industry goes through turbulent times, time and\nagain, certain airlines withstood the rough weather and other exited helplessly. Such\ncorporate debacles are due to company specific factors. Same is now being seen in telecom\nsector.\n\n\n## 8.3.4 Transactional risk\n\n\n## Risks due to the other party not fulfilling the terms of the contract while buying or selling\nequities is often referred to as transactional risk. This can happen when the other person is\neither not able to pay the money or deliver the shares. This type of risk can be mitigated by\ntransacting through the stock exchange where there are robust risk mitigation procedures\npresent to take care of such situations.\n\n\n## 8.3.5. Liquidity risk\n\n\n## Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to find a buyer or seller for the equity holdings.\nLiquidity risk is measured by impact cost. The impact cost is the percentage price movement\ncaused by a particular order size (let's say an order size of Rs.1 Lakh) from the average of the\nbest bid and offer price in the order book snapshot. The impact cost is calculated for both,\nthe buy and the sell side. Less liquid stocks are more thinly traded, and a single large trade\ncan move their prices considerably. Such stocks have high impact costs. A lower market\nimpact implies the stock is more liquid.\n\n\n## 136",

However,\nonce the financial markets are open to the international investors currency risk sets in.\nCurrency risk arises due to uncontrollable, unpredictable and volatile exchange rates of\nvarious pairs of currencies. When a significant proportion of players in a financial market\nbelong to the international institutional investors groups, then that financial market is bound\nto be related to exchange rate movements. Many times we here that stock market reacts to\nFPls' buy and sell pressure, and FPIs move in and move out of a country with changes in their\nhome country interest rates, or due sudden unfavourable exchange rate movements, like\ndeep depreciations in their host countries or due to any other socio-politico-economic,\nindustry or market shocks.\n\n\n## Apart from the above most prominent risks, all other macro-economic factors like inflation,\nfuel prices, interest rates, economic growth, economic slowdown, do influence stock markets.\n\n\n## 8.4 Overview of Equity Market\n\n\n## Equity securities represent ownership claims on a company's net assets. A thorough\nunderstanding of the equity market is required to make optimal allocation to this asset class.\nThe equity market provides various choices to investors in terms of risk-return-liquidity\nprofile. There are opportunities in listed as well as unlisted equity space available.\nInvestments in listed companies are relatively more liquid than investment in unlisted\ncompanies. Listed companies have to abide by the listing norms, making this investment\nspace more regulated with better disclosures.\n\n\n## 8.5\n\n\n## Equity research and stock selection\n\n\n## As there are thousands of opportunities available to investors in the equity market, equity\nresearch and stock selection process plays a very important role in identifying stocks which\nsuit the risk-return-liquidity requirements of the investors. Equity research involves thorough\nanalysis and research of the companies and its environment. Equity research primarily means\nanalysing the company's financials and non-financial information, studying the dynamics of\nthe sector the company belongs to, competitors of the company, economic conditions etc.\nThe idea behind equity research is to come up with intrinsic value of the stock to compare\nwith market price and then decide whether to buy or hold or sell the stock. There are many\nframeworks/methodologies available for stock selection. Analysts use fundamental analysis -\ntop-down approach or bottom-up approach - quantitative screens, technical indicators etc.,\nto select stocks.\n\n\n## 8.5.1. Buy side research versus Sell Side Research\n\n\n## Though both Sell-side and Buy-side researchers and analysts take up similar works, but they\ndiffer in terms of for whom they work, their objectives, and for what are they paid.\n\n\n## 137",

They typically publish research reports on the securities of companies or industries\nwith specific recommendation to buy, hold, or sell the subject security. These\nrecommendations include the analyst's expectations of the earnings of the company and\nfuture price performance of the security (“price target”). In essence the sell-side analysts are\npaid for providing useful information to be acted upon. In this regard the expectations from\nthe sell-side research is broad guidance on multiple sectors, rather than accurate price\npredictions.\n\n\n## Buy-side analysts work for fund managers like those of mutual funds, hedge funds, pension\nfunds, or portfolio managers that purchase and sell securities for their own investment\naccounts or on behalf of their clients. These analysts generate investment recommendations\nfor their internal consumption viz. use by the fund managers within organization. Research\nreports of these analysts are generally circulated among the top management/investment\nmanagers of the employer firms as these reports contain recommendations about which\nsecurities to buy, hold or sell. Therefore, the buy-side researchers need to be more accurate\nand they are paid for their investment recommendations.\n\n\n# 8.5.2. Fundamental Analysis\n\n\n## Fundamental analysis is the process of determining intrinsic value for the stock based on the\nfundamentals that drive its intrinsic value. These values depend on underlying economic\nfactors such as future earnings or cash flows, interest rates, and risk variables. By examining\nthese factors, intrinsic value of the stock is determined. Investors should buy the stock if its\nmarket price is below intrinsic value and do not buy, or sell, if the market price is above the\nintrinsic value, after taking into consideration the transaction cost. Investors who are engaged\nin fundamental analysis believe that intrinsic value may differ from the market price but\neventually market price will merge with the intrinsic value. An investor or portfolio manager\nwho can do a superior job of estimating intrinsic value will generate above-average returns\nby acquiring undervalued securities. Fundamental analysis involves Economy Analysis,\nindustry analysis, company analysis.\n\n\n## Top-Down approach versus Bottom up Approach\n\n\n## Analysts follow two broad approaches to fundamental analysis - top down and bottom up.\nThe factors to consider are economic (E), industry (I) and company (C) factors. Beginning at\ncompany-specific factors and moving up to the macro factors that impact the performance of\nthe company is called the bottom-up approach. Scanning the macro-economic scenario and\nthen identifying industries to choose from and zeroing in on companies, is the top-down\napproach.\n\n\n## EIC framework is the commonly used approach to understanding fundamental factors\nimpacting the earnings of a company, scanning both micro and macro data and information.\n\n\n## 138",

Stock Analysis Process\n\n\n# The value of an investment is determined by its expected cash flows and the\ninvestor's/analyst's required rate of return (i.e., its discount rate). The expected cashflows as\nwell as required rate of return are influenced by the economic environment. The analyst\nneeds to have a good understanding of important economic variables and economic series.\nThe macroeconomic analysis provides a framework for developing insights into sector and\ncompany analysis.\n\n\n## Economy Analysis\n\n\n## Macro-economic environment influences all industries and companies within the industry.\nMonetary and fiscal policy influences the business environment of the industries and\ncompanies. Fiscal policy initiatives like tax reduction encourages spending while removal of\nsubsidies or additional tax on income discourage spending. Similarly, monetary policy may\nreduce the money supply in the economy affecting the expansionary plans and working\ncapital requirements of all the businesses. Hence a thorough macro-economic forecast is\nrequired to value a sector/firm/equity.\n\n\n# Any macro-economic forecast should include estimates of all of the important economic\nnumbers, including:\n\n\n# Gross Domestic Product\n\n- Inflation rates\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Interest rates\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Unemployment\n\n\n## The most important thing an analyst does is to watch for releases of various economic\nstatistics by the government, Reserve Bank of India and private sources. Especially, they keep\na keen eye on the Index of economic indicators like the WPI, CPI, monthly inflation indices,\nIndex of Industrial Production, GDP growth rate etc. Analysts assess the economic and\nsecurity market outlooks before proceeding to consider the best sector or company. Interest\nrate volatility affects different industries differently. Financial institution or bank stocks are\ntypically placed among the most interest-sensitive of all sectors. Sectors like pharmaceuticals\nare less affected by interest rate change.\n\n\n## The economy and the stock market have a strong and consistent relationship. The stock\nmarket is known as a leading economic indicator. A leading economic indicator is a measure\nof economic recovery that shows improvement before the actual economy does because\nstock price decisions reflect expectations for future economic activity, not past or current\nactivity. Sometimes, though, the market can run ahead or lag behind the economy, driven by\nsentiments and cash flows.\n\n\n## 139",

Industry\nanalysis helps identify both unprofitable and profitable opportunities. Industry analysis\ninvolves conducting a macro analysis of the industry to determine how different industries\nrelate to the business cycle.\n\n\n## Performance of industries is related to the stage of the business cycle. Different industries\nperform differently in different stages of the business cycle. On the basis of the relationship\ndifferent sectors share with the business cycles, they are classified as cyclical and noncyclical\nsectors. For example, banking and financial sector perform well towards the end of a\nrecession. During the phase of recovery, consumer durable sectors like producers of cars,\npersonal computers, refrigerators, tractors etc., become attractive investments. Cyclical\nindustries are attractive investments during the early stages of an economic recovery. These\nsectors employ high degree of operating costs. They benefit greatly during an economic\nexpansion due to increasing sales, as they reap the benefits of economies of scale. Similarly,\nsectors employing high financial leverage also benefit during this phase, as debt is good in\ngood times.\n\n\n## At the peak of the business cycle, inflation increases as demand overtakes supply. Inflation\nimpacts different industries differently. There are industries, which are able to pass on the\nincrease in the costs of products to their consumers by increasing prices. Their revenue and\nprofits may remain unaffected by inflation. Industries producing basic materials such as oil\nand metals benefits the situation. Rising inflation doesn't impact the cost of extracting these\nproducts. These industries can increase prices and experience higher profit margins.\nHowever, there are industries that are not able to charge the increased costs of production\nto their consumers. Their profitability suffer due to inflation.\n\n\n## During a recession phase also, some industries do better than others. Defensive industries\nlike consumer staples, such as pharmaceuticals, FMCG, outperform other sectors. Even\nthough the spending power of consumer is going down, people still spend money on\nnecessities.\n\n\n# Analysts also see the stage of the Industry is in its life cycle. The number of stages in the life\ncycle of the industry are depicted in Figure 8.2:\n\n\n# Figure 8.2: Industry Life Cycle\n\n\n## 140\n\n\n<!-- Page 141 -->\n\n\n# Industry Life Cycle\n\n\n# Industry output\n\n\n# LABE\n\n\n## introduction\n\n\n## growth\n\n\n## Time\n\n\n## maturity\n\n\n## decline\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Introduction: during this stage industry experiences modest sales and very small or\nnegative profit. The market of the products of the industry is small and the firms in\nthe industry may have high development costs.\n\n\n## Growth: during this stage, market develops for the products or services of the\nindustry. Number of firms in the industry is less during this phase and hence they may\nhave little competition. Profit margins at this stage are generally high. This stage is\nfollowed by mature industry growth. The rapid growth of the earlier phase attracts\ncompetitors contributing profits margins to go to normal levels.\n\n\n## Maturity: This is generally the longest phase in the life cycle of the industry. During\nthis stage, growth rate in the industry normally matches with the economy's growth\nrate. Firms in the industry differ from one another given their cost structure and ability\nto control costs. Competition is high during this stage reducing the profit margin to\nnormal levels.\n\n\n## Deceleration of growth and decline: This stage observes decline is sales due to shift\ndemand. Profits margins are under pressure and some firms may even witness\nnegative profits.\n\n\n## Company Analysis\n\n\n## Company analysis is the final step in the top-down approach to Stock Analysis.\nMacroeconomic analysis prepares us to understand the impact of forecasted macro-\neconomic environment on different asset classes. It enables us to decide how much exposure\nto be made to equity. Industry analysis helps us in understanding the dynamics of different\nindustries in the forecasted environment. It enables us to identify industries that will offer\nabove-average risk-adjusted performance over the investment horizon. If trends are\nfavourable for an industry, the company analysis focusses on firms in that industry that are\npositioned to benefit from the economic trends. The final investment decision to be made is\nwith regard to which are the best companies in the desirable industries? And are they\nattractive investments in terms of risk-adjusted returns.\n\nCompany analysis is to be differentiated from stock valuation. Company analysis is conducted\n\n\n## 141",

These inputs are used to\ndetermine the fundamental intrinsic value of the company's stock. Then this value is\ncompared with the market price of the stock. If the intrinsic value is higher than the market\nprice, the stock is bought and vice versa. It is very important to note that stocks of good\ncompanies need not make good investment opportunities. The stock of a good company with\nsuperior management and strong performance measured by current and future sales and\nearnings growth can be trading at a price much higher to its intrinsic value. It may not make\na good investment choice.\n\n\n## Company analysis is needed to determine the value of the stock. There are many components\nto company analysis. Financial statement analysis of the company is often the starting point\nin analysing a company. Analysing the profit and loss account, balance sheet and the cash\nflow statement of the company is imperative. The financial performance numbers of a\ncompany, as presented in the financial statements, can be used to calculate ratios that give a\nsnapshot view of the company's performance. The ratios of a company have to be seen in\nconjunction with industry trends and historical averages.\n\n\n## Another important component of company analysis is SWOT Analysis. SWOT analysis involves\nexamination of a firm's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Strengths and\nweaknesses deal with a company's internal ability, like a company's competitive advantage\nor disadvantages. Opportunities and threats deal with external situations and factors the\ncompany is exposed to. Opportunities include a favourable tax environment, favourable\nchange in consumer preference. An example of threat is stringent government regulation, or\na big sized competitor, or changing technology etc.\n\n\n## Company analysis also involves analysing its competitive strategies. A firm may follow a\ndefensive strategy. A defensive strategy is one where the firm positions itself in such a way\nthat its capabilities provide the best means to deflect the effect of competitive forces in the\nindustry. Alternatively, a firm may follow an offensive strategy in which the firm attempts to\nuse its strengths to affect the competitive forces in the industry.\n\n\n## 8.5.4. Estimation of intrinsic value\n\n\n# Once the analysis of the economy, industry and company is completed, the analyst can go\nahead with estimating intrinsic value of the firm's stock. Price and value are two different\nconcepts in investing. While price is available from the stock market and known to all, value\nis based on the evaluation and analysis of the entity that is undertaking the valuation of the\nstock at a point in time. It may be noted that Price is a Fact but Value is an Opinion. There are\nvarious approaches to valuation. They are explained in the subsequent paragraphs. There are\nuncertainties associated with the inputs that go into these valuation approaches. As a result,\nwith due diligence, the final output can at best be considered an educated estimate. That is\nthe reason, valuation is often considered an art as well as a science. It requires the\n\n\n## 142",

The purpose of valuation is to relate the market price of the stock to\nits intrinsic value and judge whether if it is fairly priced, over-priced or under-priced.\n\n\n## Three most popular approaches to valuation viz., discounted cashflow approach, asset-based\napproach and relative multiple based approach are discussed below.\n\n\n# 8.5.4.1. Discounted Cash Flow Model\n\n\n# Conceptually, discounted cash flow (DCF) approach to valuation is the most appropriate\napproach for valuations when three things are known:\n\n- Stream of future cash flows\n- Timings of these cash flows, and\n- Expected rate of return of the investors (called discount rate).\n\n\n## Once these three pieces of information are available, it is simple mathematics to find the\npresent value of these cash flows which a potential investor would be willing to pay today to\nreceive the expected cash flow stream over a period of time.\n\n\n## Typically, any investment involves the outflow of cash. Later the investor expects, cash inflows\nduring the investment horizon. Finally, at the time of disinvestment, the investor expects a\nlarge cash inflow - preferably larger than the original investment - representing the return of\noriginal investment with some appreciation. The same framework can be applied to valuing\nbusinesses. Popularly, profits are compared to the regular inflows from traditional\ninvestments. However, it should be appreciated that profits are accounting estimates rather\nthan facts. Because accounting standards and tax authorities permit accrual accounting, there\ncan be many valid adjustments to the figure of profit without any involvement of cashflows.\nTherefore, profits in business and returns in the form of cashflows in financial investments\nare not comparable. This gave birth to the philosophy of estimating cashflows in business\nfrom the profit figures.\n\n\n# 8.5.4.2. Asset Based Valuation\n\n\n## Asset Based valuation methodology is used in some businesses where the business is asset\nheavy, and the assets are usually reflected in the financial statements at fair market value,\nlike financial institutions, firms in real estate and gold, gems and jewellery. Under this method\nthe value of the firm is equal to the “adjusted current market values of Net Tangible,\nintangible, Financial, and Net Current Assets”. Value of equity is “value of firm less value of\nall outsider liabilities”. Significantly the issue with this approach is that it does not recognise\nthe value of future profits and cashflows of the firm, and all future possible value creation the\nfirm can do due to its research and innovation.\n\n\n## 143",

Relative Valuation\n\n\n# These values are then converted into standardized values which are in form of multiples, w.r.t\nany chosen metric of the company's financials, such as earnings, cash flow, book values or\nsales. These multiples are then applied to the respective financials of the target company for\nvaluation. Based on the value arrived and the market price of the equity shares of the\ncompany it is decided whether it is over-valued or under-valued. Relative valuation\ntechniques implicitly contend that it is possible to determine the value of an economic entity\nby comparing it to similar entities on the basis of several important ratios.\n\n\n# 8.5.5.1. P/E Ratio\n\n\n## The most common stock valuation measure used by analysts is the price to earnings ratio, or\nP/E. For computing this ratio, the stock price is divided by the EPS figure. For example, if the\nstock is trading at Rs. 100 and the EPS is Rs. 5, the P/E is 20 times. The EPS should be for latest\navailable 12 months and not just last quarter, as the EPS would be low in that case.\n\n\n## Historical or trailing P/Es are computed by dividing the current market price of the equity\nshare by the sum of the last four quarters' EPS. Forward or leading P/Es are computed by\ndividing the current market price of the equity share by the sum of the expected next four\nquarters of EPS. Current P/E Ratio is current market price of the equity share divided by the\ncurrent or the immediate recent annual EPS of a company.\n\n\n## For example, consider a company whose fiscal year ends in March every year. In order to\ncompute the forward P/E for the financial year ending 2024 (technically called FY24), an\ninvestor would add together the quarterly EPS estimates for future quarters ending June\n2024, September 2024, December 2024 and March 2024. Then the current market price of\nequity is divided by this number aggregate number to get a forward P/E Ratio.\n\n\n## A stock's P/E tells us how much an investor is willing to invest in an equity share, per rupee of\nearnings. Therefore a P/E ratio of 10 suggests that investors in the stock are willing to invest\nRs. 10 for every Re. 1 of earnings that the company generates.\n\n\n## For judging whether the target firm is fairly valued, undervalued or overvalued, its PE ratio is\ncompared with the market PE ratio (i.e. of Nifty 50, S&P Sensex, SX40, among others), or the\naverage PE ratio of the industry to which it belongs, or with the PE ratios of peer group\ncompanies. For example, the PE Ratio of the target company is 18, and that of the industry,\nmarket or the comparable firms is 22, then the firm is judged to be undervalued.\n\n\n## There are certain limitations to using the PE ratio as a valuation indicator. The projected P/E\nratios are calculated based on analyst estimates of future earnings that may not be accurate.\nPE ratios of companies that are not profitable, and consequently have a negative EPS, are\ndifficult to interpret. P/E ratios change constantly and the ratio needs to be recomputed every\ntime there is a change in the price or earnings estimates.\n\n\n## 144",

For\nexample, all things being equal, a Rs.10 stock is enjoying a P/E of 75, then it is should be\nconsidered \"expensive\" than a Rs.100 stock with a P/E of 20.\n\n\n## 8.5.5.2. Price to Book Value Ratio\n\n\n# Price to Book Value (P/BV) is another relative valuation ratio used by investors. It compares a\nstock's price per share (market value) to its book value of equity per share. The P/BV ratio is\nan indication of how the market is valuing the book value of equity or how much more or less\nare the shareholders valuing the equity to be. The market price being above or below the\nbook value is much to do with market players and investor's expectations of the value\n\n\n## currently not recognised in the books.\n\n\n## Price/Book~ValueRatio=\\frac{Stock~Priceper~Share}{Shareholders^{*}Equity~per~Share}\n\n\n# The book value per share is calculated by dividing the reported shareholders' equity by the\nnumber of equity shares outstanding. Care should be taken to exclude any existing\nmiscellaneous assets in the balance sheet from the reported shareholder's equity value.\nReason is, the value equity has already been eroded as per books, to the extent of value of\n\n\n## miscellaneous assets.\n\n\n# If a company's stock price (market value) is lower than its book value, it can indicate one of\ntwo possibilities. The first scenario is that the stock is being incorrectly undervalued by\ninvestors due to lack of information, and hence the company's stock represents an attractive\nbuying opportunity. On the other hand, if the company is being correctly valued in the opinion\nof the investors, then it is due to, the existence of some \"value less\" assets in the books or\n\n\n## fictitious profits or reserves in the shareholder's equity.\n\n\n## The use of book value as a valuation parameter also has limitations because a company's\nassets are recorded at historical cost less depreciation. Depending on the age of these assets\nand their physical location, the difference between current market value and book value can\nbe substantial. Also, assets like intellectual property are difficult to assess in terms of value.\nHence, book value may undervalue these kinds of assets.\n\n\n## Though P/B ratio has its shortcomings but is still widely used as a valuation metric especially\nin valuing financial services and banking stocks where the assets are expected to be marked\n\n\n## to market.\n\n\n# 8.5.5.3. P/S Ratio\n\n\n## The price-to-sales ratio (Price/Sales or P/S) is calculated by taking a company's market\ncapitalization (the number of outstanding shares multiplied by the share price) and dividing\n\n\n## 145",

The logics applied for\nidentifying the undervalued and overvalued shares are similar in this multiple too. Sometimes\nconcerns are raised regarding the tendency of the firms to manipulate earnings. In such\nsituations, price to sales ratio can be used instead of earning based ratios as sales are less\nprone to manipulation. Also, in case of companies not earning profits yet, or companies in\nhigh volume low margin businesses instead of earning based ratios investors can look at the\nP/S ratio to determine whether the stock is undervalued or overvalued.\n\n\n## 8.5.5.4. PEG Ratio\n\n\n# This valuation measure takes three factors into account - the price, earnings and earnings\ngrowth rates. The formula used to compute the PEG ratio is as below:\n\n\n# PEG~Ratio=\\frac{Price/Eamings(P/E)Ratio}{Earnings~Per~Share(EPS)Growth}\n\n\n## , usually 5 years\n\n\n## (EPS is calculated as Profit after tax (PAT)/Number of outstanding common shares of the\ncompany)\n\n\n## This ratio may be interpreted as the price that an investor is willing to pay for a company, isas\njustified by the growth in earnings. The assumption with high P/E stocks is that investors are\nwilling to buy at a high price because they believe that the stock has significant growth\npotential. The PEG ratio is an improvisation of the PE ratio using a companion variable called\ngrowth. Using either the industry or the comparable firms' PEG ratios one can decide whether\nthe target firm's equity is overvalued or undervalued. The PEG ratio may show that one\ncompany, compared to another, may not have the growth rate to justify its higher P/E, and\nits stock price may appear overvalued.\n\n\n## The thumb rule is that if the PEG ratio is 1, it means that the market is valuing a stock in\naccordance with the stock's estimated EPS growth. If the PEG ratio is less than 1, it means\nthat the stock's price is undervalued given its growth rate. On the other hand, stocks with high\nPEG ratios greater than 1 can indicate just the opposite that the stock is currently\novervalued. This is based on an assumption that P/E ratios should approximate the long-term\ngrowth rate of a company's earnings.\n\n\n## -\n\n\n## The efficacy of the PEG ratio as a valuation measure will depend upon the accuracy with which\nthe earnings growth numbers are estimated. Overestimation or underestimation of future\nearnings will lead to erroneous conclusions about the valuation of the share.\n\n\n## 8.5.5.5.

One is to understand how much capital is actually\ncommitted in the enterprise that is revenue generating. The other is when some entity is\ninterested to acquire another firm, how much cash would be required to buy the target firm.\nThe assumption is that no entity would be interested in paying cash to acquire cash.\n\n\n## EV can be related to Earnings/Cash from Operations available to the (entire fund providers\ni.e. equity and debt holders) The appropriate financial metric would be - Earnings before\nInterest and Taxes EBIT. However EBIT is again influenced by the accrual mechanics of the\naccounting system, and hence to adjust it to make it a cashflow based measure, analyst have\ncoined EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortisation). The EV/EBITDA\nmultiple is extremely useful in valuing firms which are highly capital intensive and they are\nnot yet making book profits at PAT level or at EBIT level, however, at a gross level and in terms\nof cash available to the fund providers (i.e. EBITDA) it is surplus.\n\n\n## 8.5.5.7. EV/S Ratio\n\n\n# Enterprise value-to-sales (EV/sales) compares the enterprise value (EV) of a company to its\nannual sales. The EV/sales multiple enables investors to value a company based on its sales,\nwhile taking account of both the company's equity and debt. This ratio is more comprehensive\nthan Price to Sales Ratio because it takes into consideration company's debt while P/S does\n\n\n## 147",

This ratio is\nmore meaningful when the firm is highly capital intensive and its sales and profits cannot be\n\n\n## ascribed only to equity investments.\n\n\n# 8.5.5.8 Dividend yield\n\n\n# The dividend yield is obtained by dividing the dividend per share declared by the company by\nthe market price of the company. Thus it will show what would be return from dividend for\nan investor who buys the shares of the company at the current market price. The dividend\nyield gives a better picture of the return from dividend for the investor as compared to just\nlooking at the dividend per share.\n\nDividend yield = Dividend per share/ Market price of the share *100\n\n\n## For example, a company which is trading at Rs 40 and declaring a dividend of Rs 2 per share\nwill have a dividend yield of 5 per cent.\n\n\n## 8.5.5.9 Earnings yield\n\n\n# The earnings yield for a company is determined by dividing the earnings per share of a\ncompany by the market price of the company. This shows the earnings that are generated by\nthe company at the current market price. It is one of the factors that is seen to determine the\n\n\n## undervaluation or overvaluation of a stock.\n\n\n## Earnings~yield=Earnings~per~share/Market~price~per~share*100\n\n\n## For example, a company with an earnings per share of Rs 2.5 when the market price if Rs 25\ngives an earnings yield of 10 per cent. This ratio is the inverse of the P/E ratio.\n\n\n## 8.5.5.10. Industry/sector specific valuation metrices\n\n\n# As discussed above, there are different valuation tools. No one method is perfect for all the\nsectors and companies. Different sectors are valued on different metrices. Non-cyclical\nsectors like FMCG and Pharma which generate predictable cashflows can be valued using\ndiscounted cashflow technique. Replacement cost method is applied for valuing businesses\nwhich are capital intensive like cement and steel. Relative valuation tools like P/E Ratio are\nused as add on metrics across all sectors. It is also popularly used to comment on the valuation\nof market, comparing it with other markets and also doing comparison over a period of time.\nOften newspapers and media report the P/E ratio of the market and comment that it is\nexpensive or cheap, compare to other emerging markets. P/B ratio is very popular among\nbanks and financial service sector. Investors/analyst should understand the characteristics\n\nand attributes of the sector before they select a particular valuation tool.\n\n\n# 8.6 Combining Relative Valuation And Discounted Cash Flow Models\n\n\n## Discounted cash flow models are used to estimate the intrinsic value of the stock or entity.\nThe relative valuation metrices are used to determine the value of an economic entity (i.e.,\n\n\n## 148",

Discounted cash\nflow models are dependent on (1) the growth rate of cash flows and (2) the estimate of the\ndiscount rate. Relative Valuation techniques compare the stock price to relevant variables\nthat affect a stock's value, such as earnings, cash flow, book value, and sales etc.,\n\n\n# A deeper look into the two techniques will reveal that multiples are merely a simplified\nversion of DCF. All of the fundamental drivers of business value are incorporated in both\ntechniques.\n\n\n# Let us look at the P/E ratio to understand the connection between discounted cash flow\ntechniques and relative valuation metrices:\n\n\n# P/E Ratio = Price / Expected Earnings Per Share\n\n\n## This ratio compares the price of the stock to the earning it generates. The rationale lies in the\nfundamental concept that the value of an asset is the present value of its future return.\n\n\n# 8.7 Technical Analysis\n\n\n## Technical analysis is based on the assumption that all information that can affect the\nperformance of a stock, company fundamentals, economic factors and market sentiments, is\nreflected already in its stock prices. Accordingly, technical analysts do not care to analyse the\nfundamentals of the business. Instead, the approach is to forecast the direction of prices\nthrough the study of patterns in historical market data - price and volume. Technicians\n(sometimes called chartists) believe that market activity will generate indicators in price\ntrends that can be used to forecast the direction and magnitude of stock price movements in\nfuture.\n\n\n# There are three essential elements in understanding price behaviour:\n\n- The history of past prices provides indications of the underlying trend and its direction.\n- The volume of trading that accompanies price movements provides important inputs\non the underlying strength of the trend.\n- The time span over which price and volume are observed factors in the impact of long-\nterm variables that influence prices over a period of time.\n\n\n## 8.7.1 Assumptions of technical analysis\n\n\n# From the above discussion on what technical analysts do, the following assumption are\ndelineated:\n\n- The market price is determined by the interaction of supply and demand.\n2. Supply and demand are governed by many rational and irrational factors.\n- Price adjustments are not instantaneous and prices move in trends\n- Trends persist for appreciable lengths of time.\n- Trends change in reaction to shifts in supply and demand relationships.\n\n\n## 149",

Fundamental analysts believe\nthat prices will move towards their intrinsic value sooner or later. Technical analysis is not\nconcerned whether the stock is trading at a fair price relative to its intrinsic value. It limits\nitself to the future movements in prices as indicated by the historical data. It is used for short-\nterm term trading activities and not necessarily long-term investing. There is a saying, identify\na stock through fundamental analysis and do the timing through technical analysis. Having\nsaid that, investors are encouraged to be long-term investors and not traders i.e. not to time\nthe market.\n\n\n## 8.7.3 Advantages of technical Analysis\n\n\n## Technicians feel that the major advantage of their method is that it is not heavily dependent\non financial accounting statements. They feel that a great deal of information is lacking in\nfinancial statements. They also contend that a lot of non-financial information and\npsychological factors do not appear in the financial statements.\n\n\n## Technicians also feel that unlike fundamental analysts, they do not need to collect\ninformation to derive the intrinsic value of the stocks. They only need to quickly recognize a\nmovement to a new equilibrium value for whatever reason. Hence, they save time in\ncollecting enormous information and data which is a prerequisite for fundamental analysis.\n\n\n## 8.7.4 Technical Rules and Indicators\n\n\n# There are numerous trading rules and indicators. There are indicators of overall market\nmomentum, used to make aggregate market decisions. There are trading rules and indicators\nto be applied for individual securities. Some of the popular ones are:\n\n- Trend-line analysis\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Moving averages\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Bollinger-Band Analysis\n\n\n## Trend-Line Analysis\n\n\n## The graph shows a peak and trough, along with a rising trend channel, a flat trend channel, a\ndeclining trend channel, and indications of when a technical analyst would ideally want to\ntrade.\n\n\n## 150\n\n\n<!-- Page 151 -->\n\n\n# Stock price trend line\n\n\n# Stock\nPrice\n\n\n# Declining\nTrend\nChannel\n\n\n# Peak\n\n\n# Sell Point\n\n\n## Trough\n\n\n# Rising Trend\nChannel\n\n\n## Buy Point\n\n\n# Declining\nTrend\nChannel\n\n\n# Flat Trend Channel\n\n\n## Buy Point\n\n\n## Trough\n\n\n## Moving-Average Analysis\n\n\n## Moving-Average Analysis is the most popular technical indicator. The moving average of a\ntime series of past prices can provide a non-linear graph of price movements. Generally, a 5,\n10, 30, 50, 100, and 200 days moving averages are calculated. One simple strategy for using\nthe moving-average analysis is to buy when the price is sufficiently below the moving average\nand sell when the price is sufficiently above the moving average.\n\n\n## Bollinger-Band Analysis\n\n\n# Bollinger bands use normal distribution to calculate the deviation of the market price from\nthe moving average. For example, when the price goes two standard deviations above the\nmoving average, the stock might be regarded as overbought. If the price goes two standard\ndeviations below the moving average, the stock might be regarded as oversold.\n8.7.5 Fixed income securities and Technical analysis\n\n\n## Technical analysts use past prices and trading volume or both to predict future prices. A broad\nrange of techniques and indicators based on price and volume data such as chart analysis,\nmoving averages, filters and oscillators are used to identify predictable patterns in stock\nprices. The techniques depicted above can also be applied to the fixed income securities as\nlong as price and volume data is available. The theory and rationale for technical analysis of\nbonds are the same as for stocks, and many of the same trading rules are in fact used by\nanalysts in bond markets.\n\n\n## 8.8 Qualitative evaluation of stocks\n\n\n## While analysing companies, the qualitative aspects of the companies are equally important if\nnot more. Corporate governance practices are the cornerstone in evaluating a business.\nCorporate governance has become a well-discussed topic in the business world. Newspapers\nand media report detailed accounts of corporate fraud, accounting scandals, and excessive\ncompensation etc., some leading to even bankruptcy of the companies fraught in such mis\ngovernance.\n\n\n## 151",

It plays a crucial role\nin economic growth by channeling funds from savers to investors willing to take risks. Unlike\nthe equity market, debt investments are relatively safer as they are often secured by physical\nassets. However, in case of default, recovering funds can be a lengthy legal process, making a\ncompany's goodwill a key factor in honoring debt obligations.\n\n\n## Debt financing involves borrowing with fixed obligations, whereas equity financing grants\nownership rights. Governments and corporates raise debt for funding needs, with primary\nmarkets facilitating direct issuance and secondary markets enabling liquidity and risk\nassessment.\n\n\n## India's debt market has three key segments: (a) Government securities (G-secs, T-bills, SDLs),\n(b) PSU and bank bonds, and (c) private sector instruments like bonds, debentures, and\ncommercial papers. A well-developed debt market requires strong legal frameworks and\ncredit risk assessments to attract investors.\n\n\n## 9.2 Bond market ecosystem\n\n\n## Since bonds create fixed financial obligations on the issuers, they are referred as fixed income\nsecurities. The issuer of a bond agrees to 1) pay a fixed amount of interest (known as coupon)\nperiodically and 2) repay the fixed amount of principal (known as face value) at the date of\nmaturity. The fixed obligations of the security are the most defining characteristic of bonds.\nMost bonds make semi-annual interest payments, though some may make annual, quarterly\nor monthly interest payments (except zero coupon bonds which make no interest payment).\n\n\n## 152",

    "page_content": "<!-- Page 153 -->\n\n\n# Typically, par value of the bond is paid on the maturity date. Bonds have fixed maturity dates\nbeyond which they cease to exist as a legal financial instrument. (except perpetual bonds,\nwhich have no maturity date). On the basis of term to maturity, bonds with a year or less than\na year maturity are terms as money market securities. Long-term obligations with maturities\nin excess of 1 year, are referred to as capital market securities. Thus, long term bonds as they\nmove towards maturity become money market securities.\n\n\n## The coupon, maturity period and principal value are important intrinsic features of a bond.\nThe coupon of a bond indicates the interest income/coupon income that the bond holder will\nreceive over the life (or holding period) of the bond.\n\n\n## The term to maturity is the time period before a bond matures (or expires). All G-Secs are\nnormally coupon (interest rate) bearing and have semi-annual coupon or interest payments\nwith a tenor of between 5 to 30 years. Maturity period is also known as tenor or tenure.\n\n\n## The principal or par value of the bond is the original value of the obligation. Principal value of\nthe bond is different from the bond's market price, except when the coupon rate of the bond\nand the prevailing market rate of interest is exactly the same. When coupons and the\nprevailing market rate of interest are not the same, market price of the bond can be lower or\nhigher than principal value. If the market interest rate is above the coupon rate, the bond will\nsell at a discount to the par value. If the market rate is below the bond's coupon, the bond\nwill sell at a premium to the par value. The interest rate here is assumed to be for the\nremaining maturity of the bond.\n\n\n# Another interesting thing about bonds is that unlike equity, companies can issue many\ndifferent bond issues outstanding at the same time. As per regulation, maximum 12 ISINS can\nmature in one financial year. Companies re-issue existing ISINS. For completely new issuances\n(ISINS), the limit of 12 is applicable. These bonds can have different maturity periods and\ncoupon rates. These features of the bonds will be part of the indenture.9\n\n\n## Bonds with options\n\n\n## Bonds can also be issued with embedded options. Some common types of bonds with\nembedded options are: bonds with call option, bonds with put option and convertible bonds.\n\n\n# A callable bond gives the issuer the right to redeem all or part of the outstanding bonds before\nthe specified maturity date. Callable bonds are advantageous to the issuer of the security but\nthey present investors with a higher level of reinvestment risk than non-callable bonds. The\nissuer will call the bond before its maturity only when the interest rates for similar bonds fall\nin market. The investor will receive the face value of the bond before its maturity, and will be\n\n9 Indenture is the legal agreement between two parties, in case of bond indenture the two parties are the bond issuer\n(borrower) and the investors (lender).\n\n\n## 153",

This is called\nreinvestment risk.\n\n\n# A put provision gives the bondholders the right to sell the bond back to the issuer at a pre-\ndetermined price on specified dates. Puttable bonds are beneficial to the bondholder by\nguaranteeing a pre-specified selling price at the redemption dates.\n\n\n## A convertible bond is a combination of a plain vanilla bond plus an embedded equity\nconversion option. It gives the bondholder the right to exchange the bond for a specified\nnumber of common shares of the issuing company.\n\n\n## 9.3 Risks associated with fixed income securities\n\n\n## Investors need to understand the risks involved in a fixed income asset before investing in it.\nGovernment bonds are considered as risk free and hence provide low return on investment\nwhile corporate bonds in general being riskier provide higher returns to the investor\n(assuming both were held from issue date till the maturity date). Entities like public sector\nundertakings or banks are relatively less risky vis-à-vis the pure corporate firms and thus\nprovide returns higher than the government bonds but lower than the corporate papers.\nUnderstanding the relative risk involved in fixed income assets helps investors to decide the\ntype of risk they are willing to take while investing. Major risk comes from changes in interest\nrate levels in the economy and change in the creditworthiness of the borrower. The first group\nof risk is known as Market Risk while the second group of risk is known as Credit Risk or Default\nRisk.\n\n\n# 9.3.1 Interest Rate Risk\n\n\n## The bonds are subject to risk emanating from interest rate movements. The price of the bond\nis inversely related to the interest rate movement. If the interest rate rises, the price of the\nbond will fall.\n\n\n## Any investment in bonds has two risks – market risk and credit risk. Market risk can be\nexplained by the change in the price of the bond resulting from change in market interest\nrates. Further, the coupons that would be received at different points in time in future need\nto be re-invested at the rate prevailing at the time of receipt of such coupons. An investor\nholding bonds would face an erosion in value if the interest rates rise and this can lead to a\ncapital loss if the bonds are sold below their purchase price. On the other hand, a fall in\ninterest rates would push up the bond prices and this can raise the overall returns for the\ninvestor. Hold till maturity (HTM) can obviate interest rate risk because on maturity, you\nreceive what was initially contracted.\n\n\n## 9.3.2. Call risk\n\n\n## The Call risk is the risk of a bond being prematurely called or repaid by the issuer exercising\nthe right provided in the indenture of the issuance. The Call risk gives the right to the issuer\n\n\n## 154",

This low cost of borrowing may be\npossible if the company's credit rating has improved or if the market condition has changed\nin a manner that would help the company to source funds at a low interest rate. The call risk\nmakes the bond unattractive to the investor vis-à-vis a non-embedded option bond. The call\nrisk increases uncertainties for the investor.\n\n\n# 9.3.3. Reinvestment Risk\n\n\n## Reinvestment risk arises when the periodic income received from bonds or other fixed income\nsecurities are reinvested after their receipt at the rate prevailing in the market at the time of\nsuch receipts. If the interest rate is higher at the time of receipt of periodic coupon, the\nreinvestment would happen at a higher rate that would be beneficial to the investor but if\nthe market interest rate is low at the time of receipt of the coupons, the investor would be\nreinvesting the coupons at a lower rate. However, it may be remembered that higher interest\nrate vis-à-vis the coupon would mean capital loss in the market value of the bond if the\ninvestor wants to sell in the market. Therefore, reinvestment risk is the risk that interest rates\nmay decrease during the life of the bond. If an investor wants to hold the security till maturity,\nthen reinvestment risk is very high. Reinvestment risk is an important part of bond\ninvestment.\n\n\n# 9.3.4. Credit Risk\n\n\n## Bonds are essentially certificates of debt or in other words loans from the investors to the\nissuers who promise to repay the principal amount with periodic interest/coupon payments.\nParticularly for bonds issued by non-government corporates, the repayment of the principal\nback to the investor relies heavily on the issuer's ability to repay that debt. The price of these\nbonds depends on the credibility of the company issuing it and often offer a yield higher than\nthe risk-free government bonds as the investors are at a risk of losing their capital if the\nfinancials of the issuer deteriorate. For example, in India, Corporate Deposits and NCDs offer\nhigher rates on investment.\n\nTypes of credit risk include: Downgrade Risk, Spread Risk and Default Risk\n\n\n# 9.3.4.1. Downgrade Risk\n\n\n# A company's ability to operate and repay its debt (and individual debt) issues is frequently\nevaluated by major ratings agencies. Downgrade risk arises for investors when the rating of\nan issuer is lowered after they have purchased its bonds. If a company's credit rating is\ndowngraded by the rating agency on account of deterioration in its financials, the issuing\n\n\n## 155",

The existing bond holders would be\nfacing this drop in price of their bonds issued by this company as the cost of funds for the\ncompany increases in the market. An example of this is the cascading effect of the rating\ndowngrades in the IL&FS case in August-September 2018.\n\n\n# 9.3.4.2. Spread Risk\n\n\n## Corporate bonds or non-Government bonds pay a spread (depending on its Credit rating) over\ncomparable Government securities as the risk increases. The spread keeps on changing\ndynamically as the situation changes in the market. In good times when the business is doing\nvery well and there is no shortage of liquidity in the system, the risk of corporate failures due\nto market conditions is very rare. A corporate can fail to perform the debt service or equity\nservice to investors only when the performance of the company drops significantly due to bad\nmanagement or bad market conditions or both. In such situations, the riskiness of the\ncompany's instruments in the market increases. Bad performance means the company would\nface cash flow problems and may not be able to meet its obligations of interest payment and\nredemption payments. This would make the company's debt very costly. The spread over\ncomparable Government securities would change keeping in mind the possible default of the\ncompany. The spread charged for higher rated papers would be far lower compared to the\nlower rated papers in the market. In tight liquidity situations or when the general market\ncondition is bad, the risk appetite drops in the market and the spread increases.\n\n\n# 9.3.4.3. Default Risk\n\n\n## Default risk is the possibility of non-payment of coupon or principal when due. Default arises\nwhen the company fails to meet its financial obligations towards interest and principal\nrepayments. While credit ratings help to measure an issuer's risk of default, there is still\nalways a risk that some unforeseen event can force the issuer to default. The spread measures\nthe default risk of a bond. If the market considers the possibility of default for a bond, the\ninterest rate for the bond would increase in the market. Junk bonds with very high credit risk\nor default risk pay very high interest rates to investors.\n\n\n# 9.3.5. Liquidity Risk\n\n\n# Liquidity risk is the risk involved with an instrument that the investor would not be able to sell\nthe investment at the time of need. Every investment is an action to defer the present\nconsumption by an investor for a future date. Hence, when the consumption time arises, the\ninvestor must be able to monetize the investment and convert the same to cash without loss\nof much of its intrinsic value. If the market is liquid to absorb the selling, then the investor\nwould not lose substantially as there would be other investors willing to take the risk on the\nasset by buying the same from one investor selling the asset. When liquidity is tight in the\n\n\n## 156",

Hence, liquidity risk is very common on long-term bonds.\nShort-term instruments are more liquid as they are like cash instruments whose cash flows\nwould come to the investors shortly but long-term investments pose risk of selling. Better the\ncredit quality of the bond e.g. G-Sec or AAA rated corporate bond, lower is the impact cost.\n9.3.6. Exchange Rate Risk\n\n\n## Bonds issued in foreign currency are exposed to currency risk or exchange rate risk. When the\nissuer of a foreign currency bond has to pay back the bond principal or pay a promised\nperiodic coupon, the company has to acquire foreign currency from the market to fulfil its\nobligations. The cost of acquiring such foreign exchange may increase if the domestic\ncurrency has depreciated against the currency in which bonds have been issued. Currency risk\nis an inherent risk for bonds issued in non-domestic currency by domestic borrowers in the\ninternational market. Masala Bonds issued by Indian entities expose the investors to the\nExchange rate risk as the Rupee amount if fixed and the investors who are foreign entities\nwould receive Indian Rupee and have to buy the foreign currency for repatriation. Exchange\nrate risk is very important for foreign currency denominated bonds.\n\n\n# 9.3.7. Inflation Risk\n\n\n## Inflation risk is the risk faced by an investor of inadequacy of funds received from the bond\ninvestment to fulfil the deferred needs. While investing in the bond, the investor expected a\nreturn level keeping in mind the stable interest rate as the assumption of stable inflation\nwould have helped him in such assumptions. However, if suddenly the inflation rate increases,\nthe cost of goods would increase and the real return comes down. The nominal return may\nremain the same but the real income after adjustment of inflation would be far lower. A fixed\nrate bond does not take into account changing future scenarios while a floating rate bond can\ntake care of such changes as the new interest rate would be keeping in sync with the market\nrate. When expected inflation levels are higher, investors prefer floating rate bonds or\ninflation-indexed bonds to save themselves from the risk of higher inflation. However, the\nissuance quantum / market segment for floating rate bonds and inflation-indexed bonds is\nlimited.\n\n\n# 9.3.8. Volatility Risk\n\n\n## Volatility risk affects the bonds with embedded options. The pricing of an embedded option\nbond takes into account the volatility level to price the same.\n\n\n## 157",

Tax free bonds may become\ntaxable because, changes in Government rules would impact the price of such tax free bonds,\nbut this is unlikely. Further, if an issuer decides not to pay a coupon due to its tight cash\nposition or plan to roll over its debt or pay a coupon in the form of new bonds, this can lead\nto substantial value change for the bonds as investors face higher risk of non-receipt of\nrequired cash on planned dates. Government changing repatriation rules may affect the\nforeign bond investors in a domestic economy.\n\n\n# 9.3.10. Event Risk\n\n\n## An event risk refers to an unexpected or unplanned event that forces the value of an\ninvestment to drop substantially. Certain events may force companies to seek moratorium on\nrepayment as their business gets affected by such unplanned events. For example, during the\nrecent Covid-19 pandemic, the travel industry was severely impacted and many companies\ncould not service their debt. This type of risk is different for each sector and the amount of\nexposure depends on the sector.\n\n\n## 9.4 Pricing of Bond\n\n\n## The value of bonds can be determined in terms of rupee values or the rates of return they\npromise under some set of assumptions. Since bonds are fixed income securities,\ngenerating a series of pre-specified cashflows, we determine the value of the bond using\nthe present value model. The present value model computes the value for the bond using\na single discount rate. Alternatively, the yield model can be applied, which computes the\npromised rate of return based on the bond's current price and a set of assumptions.\n\n\n# 9.4.1 Par Value\n\n\n## \"Par\" is the Face value of a debt instrument which is promised to be paid as Principal at the\nmaturity of the debt instrument. Typically, it is 100 for a Government bond but ₹10000 for\na corporate bond. This is the amount that an issuer is bound to pay back to the bond investor\nas per the indenture of the debt issuance. The periodic interest/coupon paid on a debt\ninstrument is on the basis of the Face value. The Face Value is also known as the redemption\nvalue for a plain vanilla bond.\n\n\n## The market trades bonds as a percentage of price. If a trader quotes a Bid price of 106.35, the\ntrader is willing to buy the security at 106.35% of the Face Value of the security. Bonds are\nconsidered as premium ones when they trade above their Face value or Par value and are\nknown as discount bonds when they trade below the Face Value. During the life of the bond\n(from the date of issuance to date of maturity), the bond price may move from Par value to\nPremium or Discount but at the end, the bond will be pulled to the Par value of 100.\n\n\n## 158",

In this formula, the accrued interest is not discounted to arrive at\nthe Clean Price as there is no intervening cash flow in the first coupon to be received after an\n\n\n# investor buys the bond. The market convention is the amount the buyer would pay to the\nseller the clean price plus the accrual interest. This amount is often called the full-price or\ninvoice price. The price of a bond excluding accrued interest would be the clean price. The\nmarket typically trades a bond on the basis of clean price. All yield, and price formulas are on\n\n\n## the basis of clean price.\n\n\n# In order to price a bond in between coupon days, the following principles are followed. Firstly,\ntake the settlement date (buying date) to the previous coupon date and value the bond using\nthe coupon, yield and the residual maturity from the last coupon date. Secondly, bring the\nsaid price or value to the future date (settlement date or buying date) with a Future Value\nFactor. Thirdly, deduct the accrued interest from the total value to arrive at the clean price or\n\n\n## trade price or invoice price.\n\n\n## 9.4.4 Price-Yield relationship\n\n\n## The price yield relationship is inverse. When we calculate the relationship, we use the Clean\nprice only and all price and yield formulas use only Clean price.

Typically, it involves trial and\nerror by taking a value for 'r' and solving the equation and if the right-hand side is more than\n102, take a higher value of 'r' and solve again. Linear interpolation technique may also be\nused to find out exact 'r' once we have two \\primer^{\\prime} values so that the price value is more than 102\nfor one and less than 102 for the other value.

As the use of different day count\nconventions can result in different accrued interest amounts, it is appropriate that all the\nparticipants in the market follow a uniform day count convention.\n\n\n## For example, the conventions followed in Indian market for bonds is 30/360, which means\nthat irrespective of the actual number of days in a month, the number of days in a month\nis taken as 30 and the number of days in a year is taken as 360.\n\n\n## Whereas in the money market the day count convention followed is actual/365, which\nmeans that the actual number of days in a month is taken for number of days (numerator)\nwhereas the number of days in a year is taken as 365 days. Hence, in the case of T-Bills,\nwhich are essentially money market instruments, money market convention is followed.\nIn some countries, participants use actual/actual, some countries use actual/360 while\nsome use 30/actual. Hence the convention changes in different countries and in different\nmarkets within the same country (e.g. Money market convention is different than the\nbond market convention in India).\n\n\n# 9.5.3 Effective Yield\n\n\n## Deposit taking institutions often quote two quantities when they advertise interest rates on\nvarious products they are selling. The first would be the actual annualized interest rate which\nis nothing but the nominal rate or the stated rate. The second rate would be an equivalent\nrate that would produce the same final amount at the end of 1 year if simple interest is\napplied. This is called the \"effective yield\".

The slope of the curve gives us the relative risk\npremia for additional time we are out of money. In the yield curve presented below, taking a\nhigher risk of investing for 2 years as against 1 year results in a risk premia of 22bps. But, if\nwe invest for 3 years as against 2 year, we get a risk premia of only 13bps and the same risk\npremia is maintained for our investment for 4 years as against 3 years. The risk premia depicts\nthe perception of risk of investment that is depicted in the slope of the yield curve. Typically,\nin sovereign bond market, we see the yield curve flattens after 5-7 years as the risk of default\nis zero and investor only want a small premia to cover the liquidity risk of the investment.\nHowever, for corporate bonds, the risk premia significantly increases as the time to maturity\nincreases. The slope instead of flattening shows a good upward movement.\n\n\n## 0.062\n\n\n## SOVEREIGN YIELD CURVE Rate %\n\n\n## 0.06\n\n\n## 0.058\n\n\n## 0.056\n\n\n## 0.054\n\n\n## 0.052\n\n\n## -0.0515\n\n\n## 0.05\n\n\n## 0.048\n\n\n## 0.046\n\n\n## 0\n\n\n## 0.0548\n\n\n## 0.0994\n\n\n## -0.068\n\n\n## -0.0567\n\n\n## 2\n\n\n## 3\n\n\n## 0.0613\n\n\n## The yield curves are never smooth and people have different expectations about the future\nand may demand different rates for the same maturity investment even if the rating remains\nthe same.

A positively sloped yield curve\nis the most preferred yield curve for the economy as the shorter term would demand a lower\ninterest rate while long term would demand a higher interest rate.\n\n\n# Typically, the yield curves take 4 shapes:\n\n\n## 167",

As market rates of interest increase\n(decrease) the market values of the bond portfolios decrease (increase).\n\n\n## Duration (also known as Macaulay Duration) of a bond is a measure of the time taken to\nrecover the initial investment in present value terms.

Duration is expressed in number of years.\n\n\n## The price sensitivity of a bond to changes in interest rates is approximated by the bond's\nduration. The significance of the duration is that greater the duration, more volatile is the\nportfolio's return in respect to changes in the level of interest rates.\n\n\n## A step-by-step approach for working out duration is given below.\n\n- Calculate the present value of each of the future cash flow.\n- The present values of future cash flows are to be multiplied with their respective\ntime periods in years (these are the weights).\n- Add the weighted Present Values of all cash flows and divide it by the current price\nof the bond.\n\n\n## The resultant value is bond duration in no. of years.\n\n\n## Duration does not increase exponentially with increase in maturity of a bond and stagnates\nafter a maturity level is reached.\n\n\n## Duration is the weighted average term (time from now to payment) of a bond's cash flows or\nof any series of linked cash flows.

Participation in the\nmoney market can be broadly divided into two parts: fund raising and asset acquisition. The\nfirst refers to short term fund borrowings either by posting collateral or unsecured borrowing\nusing one's credit standing in the market. The second part addresses the market for short\nmaturity assets i.e. investors deploying over a short horizon of upto one year\n\n\n## Money market transactions are generally used for including the government securities market\nand for meeting short term liquidity mismatches. Funding purchase transactions in other\nmarkets to tide over these mismatches is the most common reasons for participating in the\nmoney market. Being a primary source of funding, a liquid money market is critical to financial\nstability. In fact, a trigger for the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 was the seizing up of the\nlending in the international overnight money markets. The money market is integral to a\ncountry's financial infrastructure and is the primary transmission channel of the central banks'\nmonetary policy.\n\n\n## 9.8.1 Key players in the money market\n\n\n# Participants in the Indian money market include: Public Sector Banks, Private Sector Banks,\nForeign Banks, Co-operative Banks, Financial Institutions, Insurance Companies, Mutual\nFunds, Primary Dealers, Bank cum Primary Dealers, Non-Banking Financial Companies\n(NBFCs), Corporates, Provident/ Pension Funds, Payment Banks, Small Finance Banks, etc.\n9.8.2Types of Instruments\n\n\n## The various products considered to be the part of the Indian money market are:\n\n\n## Instrument\n\n\n## Duration\n\n\n## Trading\n\n\n## &\n\n\n## Settlement\n\n\n## Face Value\n\n\n## Reporting\n\n\n## Call Money\n\n\n## Overnight\n\n\n## NDS-CALL\n\n\n## RBI\n\n\n## Notice Money\n\n\n## 2-14 days\n\n\n## NDS-CALL\n\n\n## RBI\n\n\n# Minimum market\norder 1 lakh\n\n\n## Minimum market\n\n\n## order 1 lakh\n\n\n## Term Money\n\n\n## 15 days - 1 year NDS-CALL\n\n\n## RBI\n\n\n## Minimum market\n\n\n## order 1 lakh\n\n\n## 169",

This\nmarket is a purely interbank market in India restricted only to Scheduled Commercial Banks\n(SCBs) and the Primary Dealers (PDs). Call money transactions are dealt/ reported on the\nReserve Bank of India's (RBI) NDS-CALL platform which is managed by CCIL and are\npredominantly overnight (tenor of borrowing may be extended to account for weekends and\nholidays).\n\n\n## Notice Money\n\n\n## This is an extension of the interbank call market with uncollateralized lending and borrowing\nof funds for a period beyond overnight and upto 14 days. Notice money transactions are\ndealt/ reported on the RBI's NDS-CALL platform which is managed by CCIL.\n\n\n## Term Money\n\n\n## This is an extension of the interbank call market for uncollateralized lending and borrowing\nof funds for a period between 15 days and 1 year. Term money transactions are dealt/\nreported on the RBI's NDS-CALL platform which is managed by CCIL.\n\n\n## Market Repo\n\n\n## 170\n\n\n<!-- Page 171 -->\n\n\n# Repo also known as a ready forward contract refers to borrowing funds via sale of securities\nwith an agreement to repurchase the same at a future date with the interest for the\nborrowings incorporated in the repurchase price. Reverse repo is the exact opposite\ntransaction which is essentially a collateralized lending of funds. Each repo/ reverse repo deal\nthus has 2 parts / legs. The repo period is the time between the 2 legs. The interest is\ncomputed on the actual amount borrowed by the repo seller which is the consideration\namount in the repo's first leg. The lender receives the interest in the second leg when the\nsecurity is bought back by the borrower at a higher consideration that includes the interest.\nRBI regulates the repo market in India and major participants are SCBs, PDs, Mutual Funds,\nNBFCs, Financial Institutions (FIs), Insurance Companies, Corporates, Provident/ Pension\nFunds, Payment Banks, Small Finance Banks, etc.\n\n\n## Repo transactions against G-secs are traded/ reported on the Clearcorp Repo Order Matching\nSystem (CROMS) electronic platform of the Clearcorp Dealing Systems. These are settled by\nCCIL along with G-secs.\n\n\n## Triparty Repo\n\n\n## \"Triparty repo\" is a type of repo contract with a third-party intermediary between the\nborrower and lender known as the Triparty Agent (TPA). The TPA does the collateral selection,\npayment and settlement, custody and management during repo period. Following RBI's\nauthorization to CCIL to act as a TPA, the 'Collateralized Borrowing and Lending Obligation'\n(CBLO) launched by CCIL on January 20, 2003 was converted into TREP on November 5, 2018.\nThe Tri Party Repo Dealing System (TREPS) anonymous order matching trading platform is\nprovided by Clearcorp Dealing Systems (India) Ltd with CCIL as the Central Counterparty (CCP)\nfor borrowing and lending of funds against government securities in India with a triparty\narrangement. All the repo eligible entities can trade on TREPS and the funds borrowed on\nTREPS are exempted from RBI's CRR/SLR computation and the security acquired under the\ndeal is eligible for SLR. Stock Exchanges have also introduced Triparty Repo on Corporate\nBonds for the benefit of investors.\n\n\n## Treasury Bills (T-bills)\n\n\n## In India Treasury bills or T-bills are used for short-term borrowing by the Government of India\nand are considered to be a part of the money market as they mature within a year from issue.\nThese are basically zero-coupon securities which are issued at a discount and are redeemed\nat par. Normally RBI conducts weekly auctions for three tenors of T-bills: 91, 182 and 364\ndays. The 14 Day T-bills are not available for public consumption. RBI may use the same for\nparking short term surplus funds of State Governments.\n\n\n## 171",

CMBS have\nmaturities less than 91 days.\n\n\n# Commercial Paper (CP)\n\n\n## A Commercial Paper (CP) is used by Indian corporates to raise short-term unsecured funds.\nCPs are also discounted instruments like T-bills and are issued for 5 lakh and multiples\nthereof for maturities between 7 days and one year. CP issuances are governed by RBI\nregulations. The corporate entities with a good credit rating (typically the minimum is the\nSecond highest credit rating) and required minimum net-worth can issue CPs. It is used as a\npart of working capital resources for corporates.\n\n\n## Certificate of Deposit (CD)\n\n\n## A Certificate of Deposit (CD) is issued against funds deposited at a bank or eligible Fls. CDs are\nissued for 1 lakh and in multiples of 1 lakh thereafter for maturities of 7 days to 364 days\nby banks and for 1 year to 3 years by Fls. Banks and Financial institutions issue CDs. Banks\nissue CDs upto one year while Financial Institutions can issue upto 3 years.\n\n\n## Corporate Bond Repo (CBR)\n\n\n## Repo in corporate bonds was introduced by RBI in 2010 and the eligible securities for CBR\ninclude: (i) Listed corporate bonds and debentures, (however, participants cannot borrow\nagainst the collateral of their own securities or those of related entities); (ii) CPs and CDs; and\n(iii) Units of Debt ETFs. Triparty repo in corporate bonds was launched in India in 2017 by\nstock exchanges and currently includes only select AAA category bonds, A1+ rated CPs and\nCDs. CBR trading can be done OTC or on stock exchanges.\n\n\n## 9.9 Introduction to Government Debt Market\n\n\n## The government securities (G-Sec) market is the most active segment of the Indian fixed\nincome securities market. Regular structural and infrastructural measures by the Government\nand Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have contributed to its substantial growth and expansion over\nthe last two decades. Along with meeting the governments' funding needs, it provides the\nbenchmark interest rates in the market for pricing of various products and schemes and is\nalso an indirect channel for monetary policy.\n\n\n## 9.9.1 Key players in the Government debt market\n\n\n# Primary participants in the Indian G-Sec market are large institutional players like banks,\nPrimary Dealers (PDs) and insurance companies.

However, RBI has made many calibrated changes to SLR\nrequirements giving more operational room to Banks for managing the liabilities and SLR has\nbeen reduced keeping in mind the phased implementation of Basel norms. Primary Dealers\n(PDs) play a very important role in the form of market making and they provide firm two way\n(buy and sell) quotes for the Government securities. Other participants include Co-operative\nBanks (after the change of application of SLR norms for them), Mutual Funds, Corporates,\nProvident and Pension Funds and Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs). Reserve Bank of India is\nalso a very large holder of Government securities as it has to operate market liquidity window.\n9.9.2 Types of Instruments\n\n\n## A Government Security (G-Sec) in Indian markets implies a debt instrument issued either by\nthe Central Government of India or the State Governments which is tradeable in nature. The\nCentral Government issues both bills (original maturities of less than one year) and bonds\nwhile the State Governments issue only bonds also known as the State Development Loans\n(SDLs). G-Secs are considered risk-free with nearly no risk of default. Each security is known\nby a unique number - ISIN (International Security Identification Number) – which is tagged to\nan instrument at the time of issuance. Over the years a variety of instruments have been\nintroduced to match the diverse risk appetites and investment horizons of the market\nparticipants. These instruments have been discussed in detail below.\n\n\n## Treasury Bills (T-bills)\n\n\n## Treasury bills or T-bills are short term money market instruments issued by the Government\nof India at a discount to its face value and are zero coupon securities issued to be redeemed\nat par (100) at maturity. The RBI issues three T-Bills for the investors – 91D, 182D and 364D.\nRBI conducts weekly auctions for these T-bills. RBI announces issuance calendar every quarter\nand issues the said T-bills as per the notified amount mentioned in the said issuance calendar.\n\n\n## Cash Management Bills (CMBS)\n\n\n## Cash Management Bills (CMBs) are basically unstructured T-bills maturing within 91 days. It\nwas launched in 2010 in order to meet the temporary shortage in the cash flow for the\nGovernment of India. CMBS have been extensively used by RBI for smoothening systemic\nissues such as liquidity management post demonetization in 2016, forex market volatility in\n2013, etc.\n\n\n## Dated G-Secs\n\n\n# Government securities are issued on the basis of issuance calendar notified by RBI in the\nmonth of March (for sale of securities between April and September) and in the month for\nSeptember (for the sake of securities between October and March). The notified amounts are\ninformed to the market well in advance. Long term bonds are usually referred to as dated\n\n\n## 173",

With maturities\nranging from one to fifty years, these securities pay a fixed or floating coupon on a semi-\nannual basis. Public Debt Office (PDO) of RBI handles the issue, makes coupon payment and\nprincipal repayment. RBI is the depository of Government securities as per the legal\nprovisions. RBI plays the role of the Merchant banker as well the role of Registrar and Transfer\nAgent (RTA) for the issue of Government securities. When coupon payment dates fall on\nholidays, the coupon amount is paid on the next working day. However, redemption proceeds\nare paid on the previous working day if a maturity date falls on a holiday. The following types\nof dated G-Secs have been issued in India.\n\n\n# Fixed Rate Bonds\n\n\n## The largest component within dated securities are fixed coupon securities or fixed rate bonds.\nThese securities pay a fixed coupon over their entire life but all coupons are paid semi-\nannually. For example: Consider the case of “5.77% GS 2030\" issued on August 3, 2020 and\nmaturing on August 3, 2030. This 10-year security pays a coupon every six months i.e. on\nFebruary 3rd and August 3rd each year till its maturity at 2.8850% (half yearly payment being\nhalf of the annual coupon of 5.77%) of the 100 face value. Coupons for these bonds are fixed\non the date of the issue and typically, the cut-off rate for the bond in the primary auction\nbecomes the Coupon for the security.\n\n\n## Floating Rate Bonds (FRB)\n\n\n## First introduced by the Government of India in September 1995, FRBS pay interest at a\nvariable coupon rate that is reset at pre-announced intervals. While majorly linked to the 6-\nmonth rate i.e. the 182 Day T-Bill rate, FRBs coupons at each semi-annual date are currently\ndetermined in various ways: (a) As the average of the implicit cut-off yields of the last three\n182 Day T-Bill auctions; (b) Base rate equivalent to weighted average yield of last three 182\nDay T-Bills auctions of plus a fixed spread; (c) Reset every five years at the prevailing 5 year\nG-Sec yield as on the last working day prior to commencement of each period of five years.\nFRBs are not preferred for investment in the market. Since retail participation in the market\nis very low, the success of FRB is also not satisfactory.\n\n\n## Zero Coupon Bonds (ZCBs)\n\n\n## ZCBs do not pay any fixed coupon and are issued at a discount and redeemed at par like T-\nBills. These had last been issued by Government of India in 1996. Currently, these securities\nare not the favour of the market.\n\n\n## Capital Indexed Bonds (CIBs)\n\n\n## The principal amount of a CIB is linked to an inflation index to protect it from inflation. RBI\nhad experimented with a 5 year CIB issued in December 1997.\n\n\n## 174",

Globally,\nwhile the United Kingdom first introduced IIBs in 1981, in India, the first IIBs (linked to\nWholesale Price Index (WPI)) were issued in June 2013. In December 2013, IIBs linked to the\nConsumer Price Index (CPI) were issued exclusively for retail customers. However, like the\nZero Coupon Bonds and Capital Indexed Bonds these bonds did not find wider acceptance\nand were discontinued after the initial issues and the Government repurchased most of the\nbonds that had already been issued.\n\n\n## Bonds with Call/Put Options\n\n\n## The Government of India has also experimented with bonds with embedded options. The first\nsuch embedded option bond with both call and put option - 6.72% GS 2012 was issued on July\n18, 2002 in which the Government had the right to buy-back the bond (call option) at par\nwhile the investors had the right to sell back the bond (put option) to the Government at par\non any of the semi-annual coupon dates beginning July 18, 2007. Currently, Government does\nnot issue any embedded option bonds.\n\n\n## Special Securities\n\n\n## Occasionally, the Government of India may issue bonds as compensation in lieu of cash\nsubsidies to entities like the Food Corporation of India, Oil Marketing Companies, Fertilizer\nCompanies, etc. (also known as food, oil bonds and fertilizer bonds respectively). Government\nof India also issues Bank recapitalization bonds under the special securities. These are not\neligible as SLR securities and thus pay a marginally higher coupon over the yield of the similar\nmaturity G-Secs.\n\n\n## Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities (STRIPS)\n\n\n## STRIPS are essentially separate ZCBs created by breaking down the cash flows of a regular G-\nSec. For example, when 100 of the 5.77% GS 2030 mentioned earlier is stripped, the 100\nprincipal payment at maturity becomes a principal STRIP while each coupon cash flow\n(2.885) becomes a coupon STRIP, which can all then be traded separately as independent\nsecurities in the secondary market. STRIPS can be created out of all existing fixed coupon SLR\neligible G-Secs. STRIPS can be attractive to retail/non-institutional investors as being ZCBs,\nthey have zero reinvestment risk.\n\n\n## Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB)\n\n\n# SGBs are unique instruments with commodity (gold) linked prices. Part of budgeted\nborrowing, these are issued in tranches and are denominated in units of one gram of gold and\nmultiples thereof.

Earlier\nissuances are available in the secondary market.\n\n\n# Savings (Taxable) Bonds\n\n\n## Specially issued for retail investors at par for a minimum amount of 1,000 (face value) and\nin multiples thereof, while these bonds have no maximum limit for investment, the interest\npaid is taxable under the Income Tax Act, 1961. From FY21, these bonds bear a floating rate\nof interest which is reset every 6 months.\n\n\n## State Development Loans (SDLs)\n\n\n## Market borrowings of State Governments / Union Territories through semi-annual coupon\npaying dated securities are known as State Development Loans (SDLs). These are eligible for\nSLR and borrowing under the LAF window. Uday bonds were special securities issued by State\nGovernments for financial turnaround of power distribution companies (DISCOMs). Uday\nbonds are not eligible for SLR status. Nowadays SDLs are also referred to as SGS (State\nGovernment Securities).\n\n\n## 9.10 Introduction to Corporate Debt Market\n\n\n## Corporate debt continues to have a low share of the total debt issuance in India. Investment\ndemand largely restricted to institutional investors whose investments are in turn limited\nby prudential norms for investment issued by their respective regulators. On the other hand,\nthe multitude of steps to be adhered to, push the potential suppliers i.e. the corporates to\nopt for bank financing or overseas borrowing to meet their funding requirements in a time\nconstrained fund raising environment.\n\n\n## Despite these inherent constraints, the Indian corporate debt market has witnessed\nsignificant growth in recent years due to the regulators' focus on enhanced transparency,\nexpanded issuer and investor base as well as availability of better market infrastructure.\nNature of secondary market participants being largely wholesale or institutional and non-\navailability of trading platforms with guaranteed central counterparty (CCP) facility are\nprimary obstacles to an active secondary market for individual investors.\n\n\n## 9.10.1 Key Players in the Corporate Bond Ecosystem in India\n\n\n## Issuer\n\n\n# The \"Issuer\" is the entity that issues a debt instrument to borrow money from the investors\nagainst a promise of paying back the principal on the maturity date along with the periodic\ninterest. The issuer may issue the bond either using a private placement option or using public\n\n\n## 176",

Privately placed debt may or may not be listed in a stock exchange.\n\n\n# Debenture Trustee\n\n\n# In India, the terms 'debenture' and 'corporate bond' are used interchangeably and both are\nidentified as the same in the Companies Act. Like a bond, a debenture is also a debt\ninstrument issued by a company to repay the borrowed sum at a specified date along with\npayment of interest. A Debenture Trustee (DT) is registered with SEBI. A DT holds the secured\nproperty on behalf of the debt issuer and for the benefit of debenture holders who though\nthe beneficiaries, have no access to the mortgaged property. Scheduled banks carrying on\ncommercial activity, insurance companies, public financial institutions or corporate bodies\ncan act as DTs.\n\n\n## DTs have the responsibility to protect the interest of the debenture holders as they have to\nensure that the property charged is available and sufficient in value terms to discharge the\ninterest and principal amounts during the life of the debenture. They call for periodic reports\nfrom the issuers and also ensure that the issuers comply with the provisions of the trust deed,\nthe Companies Act and the listing agreements of the stock exchanges. DTs on noticing any\nbreach of the trust deed or law have to act immediately to protect the interest of the\ndebenture holders. In the event of default, DTs can appoint nominee directors on the issuer's\nboard and also have the power and authority to sell the secured property to redeem the\ndebentures.\n\n\n## The SEBI (Debenture Trustees) Regulations, 1993 govern DTs in India. As per the provisions of\nCompanies Act, appointment of a DT is compulsory if any debentures/bonds are issued with\na maturity of more than18 months. Unsecured debentures/bonds are treated as fixed\ndeposits, if received from individual investors. In India, the issuer pays fees to the DT for its\nservices.\n\n\n## Qualified Institutional Buyer (QIB)\n\n\n# QIBS in the Indian market include:\n\n- Scheduled Commercial Banks\n\n\n# *Insurance Companies registered with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority\nof India (IRDAI)\n\n\n## *Mutual Funds\n\n\n# *State Industrial Development Corporations\n\n\n## *Multilateral and bilateral Development Financial Institutions\n\n\n## *Provident Funds with minimum corpus of 25 crore\n\n\n## *Pension Funds with minimum corpus of 25 crore\n\n\n## *Public Financial Institution as defined in the Companies Act\n\n\n## 177",

Since they are issued by companies they are known as company deposits. There\nis a fixed rate of interest that is paid on these deposits, which is usually higher than the bank\nfixed deposit rate depending on the financial position of the company. Investors need to look\nat the company and its financial situation before making a decision about investing in these\ndeposits. Deposits are not securities as per the definition of SCRA as these are not\ntransferable.\n\n\n## Bonds and debentures\n\n\n## These are bonds and debentures that are issued by companies and they are usually for a\nslightly longer time frame. Another factor that is present for bonds and debentures is that\nmany of them are secured in nature. This means that there is the security of an asset behind\nthese issues so there is an additional level of comfort for the investor. The risk of a credit\ndefault needs to be considered by investors when they look at such issues.\n\n\n## Infrastructure Bonds\n\n\n## The infrastructure bonds are very long-term bonds that are issued and they can be for 10 to\neven 20 years, these are meant to finance infrastructure projects and hence they are long\nterm in nature. Specific companies that operate in this space are the ones who issue these\nbonds and they are often traded in the secondary market. Investors need to analyse these in\na different light in the consideration of the projects for which the money would be used.\n\n\n## Inflation indexed bond\n\n\n## The inflation indexed bonds set themselves apart as they do not have a fixed rate of interest\non them. At a specified time interval the interest rate on these bonds will change depending\non the inflation rate in the economy. This ensures that the real rate of return for the investor\nis protected.\n\n\n## 178",

It entitles the investor to pre-determined interest payments\nand return of the deposited sum on maturity. Fixed bank deposits offer higher returns than\nsavings accounts as the money is available for use by the bank for a longer period of time.\nFixed deposits are preferred by investors who like the safety that a bank provides, want to\nknow how much they will earn and do not have an immediate need for the funds.\n\n\n## Bank FDs are considered to be a safe investment option. This is because each depositor is\ninsured up to Rs.5 lakh by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC).\nIt includes all deposits and interest on them, held across branches of a given bank. The limit\nof Rs 5 lakh per bank is a significant sum that provides an element of comfort for the investor\nas they know that their money is not going to be lost if the bank goes down.\n\n\n## A fixed deposit is created by opening an FD account with the bank which in turn issues an FD\nreceipt. Interest on an FD can be paid into the depositor's savings bank account at a\npredefined frequency, or accumulated and paid at the end of the term. On maturity, the lump\nsum deposit amount is returned to the investor.\n\n\n## Investors can also choose to renew the deposit on the maturity date. The minimum deposit\namount varies across banks. The duration of deposits can range from 7 days to 10 years\nthough FDs longer than 5 years are not very common.\n\n\n## Interest Rates on FDs\n\n\n## Interest rates depend on the duration of deposit, amount deposited and policies of the bank.\nIn general, longer-term deposits pay a higher rate than shorter term deposits. There could be\na specific time bracket that could have a higher interest rate because the bank wants to\nattract money for that specific duration. However, banks might also introduce deposits with\nspecific terms like 333 days or 777 days which can have a special rate of interest. Banks also\noffer special rates to senior citizens, defined as those who are over 60 years of age. The special\nrate is usually an amount ranging from 0.25% to 0.75% extra interest above the normal\napplicable one. Interest rates also vary from bank to bank. The interest rate paid by a bank\ndepends on its need for funds for a particular tenor.\n\n\n## Interest rates do not remain unchanged. Deposit rates offered by banks for various tenors\nchange over time, depending on the economic cycle, their need for funds and demand for\ncredit (loans) from banks. However, a rate committed to be payable for a tenor, until maturity,\ndoes not change even if market interest rates change. New rates usually apply only for fresh\ndeposits.\n\n\n## 179",

This bond was launched on July 1, 2020 with an interest rate of 7.15\nper cent. Unlike earlier bond series, where the interest rate was fixed for the entire duration\nof the bond the situation is different with this issue. The interest rate on this floating rate\nbond will be set twice a year based on the changes in the benchmark rate.\n\n\n## The interest on the bond is payable every six months and after the payment is done the\ninterest rate would be reset for the next six months. The first payment of interest would take\nplace on January 1, 2021 and then continue according to the schedule. The interest rate on\nthe bond has been linked to the rate prevailing on the National Savings Certificate (NSC). The\nrate here would be 35 basis points or 0.35% over the NSC rate.\n\n\n## A resident Indian can make an investment in these bonds while Non Resident Indians (NRIs)\nare not allowed to invest. The bonds can be bought from designated branches of a few public\nand private sector banks and will be held only in demat form. This is also called a bond ledger\naccount which are opened only with a bank for holding government securities.\n\n\n## The interest earned on these bonds is taxable and it is added to the income under the head\nof Income from other sources.\n\n\n# Small Saving Instruments¹0\n\n\n## The Indian government has instituted a number of small saving schemes to encourage\ninvestors to save regularly. The main attraction of these schemes is the implicit guarantee of\nthe government, which is the borrower. These schemes are offered through the post office\nand select banks.\n\n\n# The saving schemes currently offered by the government are:\n\n- Public Provident Fund (PPF)\n\n\n## 10http://nsiindia.gov.in/InternalPage.aspx?Circularld=9999\n\n\n## 180\n\n\n<!-- Page 181 -->\n\n- Senior Citizens' Saving Scheme (SCSS)\nNational Savings Certificate (NSC)\nPost Office Schemes and Deposits\n- Kisan Vikas Patra (KVP)\n\n\n# Sukanya Samriddhi Account\n\n\n# Public Provident Fund\n\n\n## Instituted in 1968, the objective of the PPF is to provide a long-term retirement planning\noption to those individuals who may not be covered by the provident funds of their employers\nor may be self-employed.\n\n\n## PPF is a 15-year deposit account that can be opened with a designated bank or a post office.\nIt can also be opened online with a few banks. A person can hold only one PPF account in\ntheir name except an account in the name of a minor child to whom he or she is a guardian.\nAn individual can open a PPF account at any age. HUFs and NRIs are not allowed to open PPF\naccounts. If a resident subsequently becomes an NRI during the prescribed term, he/she may\ncontinue to subscribe to the fund till its maturity on a non-repatriation basis. Joint account\ncannot be opened, however nomination facility is available.\n\n\n## National Savings Certificate (NSC)\n\n\n## National Savings Certificates are issued by the government and available for purchase at the\npost office. NSCs are issued with a tenor of 5 years (NSC VIII issue amended as of December\n1, 2011). Interest is compounded annually and accumulated and paid on maturity.\n\n\n## The certificates can be bought by individuals on their own account or on behalf of minors.\nNRI, HUF, Companies, trusts, societies, or other institutions are not allowed to purchase the\nNSCs. If a resident holder becomes an NRI subsequent to the purchase, the certificate can be\nheld till maturity. However, the maturity value cannot be repatriated. Joint holding is allowed\nand the certificate can be held jointly by up to two joint holders on joint basis or either or\nsurvivor basis.\n\n\n## Certificates are available in denominations of Rs.100, 500, 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000. The\nminimum investment is Rs.100 without any maximum limit. The certificates can be bought by\ncash or through cheques.\n\n\n## Investments made in the NSC VIII issue enjoy tax benefits under section 80C of Income Tax\nAct, 1961. Accrued interest is taxable, but is it deemed to be reinvested and therefore the\ninterest becomes eligible for Section 80C benefits. There is no tax deducted at source at the\ntime of redeeming the certificate value.\n\n\n## 181",

Derivatives are based on a wide range of underlying assets such\nas metals (Gold, silver etc.), energy resources (oil, coal, gas etc.), agri commodities (wheat,\ncoffee) and financial assets (shares, bonds).\n\n\n## In the Indian context the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 [SC(R)A] defines\n\"derivative\" to include-\n\n- A security derived from a debt instrument, share, loan whether secured or unsecured,\nrisk instrument or contract for differences or any other form of security.\n- A contract which derives its value from the prices, or index of prices, of underlying\nsecurities.\n\n\n## Derivatives are securities under the SC(R)A and hence the trading of derivatives is governed\nby the regulatory framework under the SC(R)A.\n\n\n## The term derivative has also been defined in section 45U(a) of the RBI Act 1934 as follows:\nAn instrument, to be settled at a future date, whose value is derived from change in interest\nrate, foreign exchange rate, credit rating or credit index, price of securities (also called\n\"underlying\"), or a combination of more than one of them and includes interest rate swaps,\nforward rate agreements, foreign currency swaps, foreign currency-rupee swaps, foreign\ncurrency options, foreign currency-rupee options or such other instruments as may be\nspecified by RBI from time to time.\n\n\n## 185",

The seller of gold futures thinks prices will fall, and benefits if the price falls below the\nprice at which she entered into the futures contract. The buyer of gold futures thinks prices\nwill rise, and benefits if the price rises beyond the price at which she has agreed to buy gold\nin the future. On maturity the market price of the underlying would be same for both the\nfutures contracts, leading to profits to only one of them. But when the net positions of the\nboth the buyer and seller are considered, it always amounts to zero. Hence the word Zero\nSum Game suits appropriately to describe the net positions of derivative instruments.\nHowever, there are the two usual assumptions to this conclusion, that there are no taxes and\nno transaction costs.\n\n\n## Settlement Mechanism\n\n\n## Earlier most derivative contracts were settled in cash. Cash settlement is a settlement method\nwhere upon expiration or exercise of the derivatives contract, the counterparties to the\ncontract settle their position through exchange of the price differentials and do not deliver\nthe actual (physical) underlying asset.\n\n\n## However, SEBI has mandated physical settlement (settlement by delivery of underlying stock)\nfor all stock derivatives i.e. all the stock derivatives which are presently being cash settled\nshall move compulsorily to physical settlement in a phased manner. The stock exchanges have\ninitiated the transition from cash settlement to physical settlement based on the criteria\nnotified by the relevant SEBI circulars.\n\n\n## Margining Process\n\n\n## Margin is defined as the funds or securities which must be deposited by Clearing Members as\ncollateral before executing a trade. The provision of collateral is intended to ensure that all\nfinancial commitments related to the open positions of a Clearing Member can be offset\nwithin a specified period of time.\n\n\n## There are different kinds of margins. The initial margin is charged to the trading account on\nthe assumption that the position will be carried out till the expiry of the contract. The initial\nmargin has two components; SPAN¹¹ margins and ELM (extreme loss margin) margins based\non exposure. Both margins have to be mandatorily deposited before taking a trade. The initial\nmargin should be large enough to cover the loss in 99 per cent of the cases. The greater the\nvolatility of the stock, greater the risk and, therefore greater is the initial margin.\n\n11The margin calculation is carried out using a software called - SPANⓇ (Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk). It is a product\ndeveloped by Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and is extensively used by leading stock exchanges of the world.\n\n\n## 186",

  },
  {
    "page_content": "<!-- Page 187 -->\n\n\n## In addition to Initial Margin, a Premium Margin is charged to trading members trading in\nOption contracts.\n\n\n## The premium margin is paid by the buyers of the Options contracts and is equal to the value\nof the options premium multiplied by the quantity of Options purchased.\n\n\n# Open Interest\n\n\n## Open interest is commonly associated with the futures and options markets. Open interest is\nthe total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled. The open\ninterest number only changes when a new buyer and seller enter the market, creating a new\ncontract, or when a buyer and seller meet-thereby closing both positions. Open interest is a\nmeasure of market activity. However, it is to be noted that it is not trading volume. Open\ninterest is a measure of the flow of money into a futures or options market. Increasing open\ninterest represents new or additional money coming into the market while decreasing open\ninterest indicates money flowing out of the market.\n\n\n## 10.3 Types of derivative products\n\n\n## The four commonly used derivative products are Forwards, Futures, Options and Swaps.\n10.3.1 Forwards\n\n\n## Forward contract is an agreement made directly between two parties to buy or sell an asset\non a specific date in the future, at the terms decided today. Forwards are widely used in\ncommodities, foreign exchange, equity and interest rate markets.\n\n\n## Let us understand with the help of an example. What is the basic difference between the cash\nmarket and forwards? Assume on March 9, 2018 you wanted to purchase gold from a\ngoldsmith. The market price for gold on March 9, 2018 was Rs. 30,425 for 10 gram and\ngoldsmith agrees to sell you gold at market price. You paid him Rs. 30,425 for 10 gram of gold\nand took gold. This is a cash market transaction at a price (in this case Rs. 30,425) referred to\nas spot price.\n\n\n## Now suppose you want to agree to buy gold on March 9, 2018, but take delivery of the same\nand pay for the same only after 1 month. Goldsmith quotes you Rs. 30,450 for 10 grams of\ngold to be delivered after 1 month. You agree to the forward price for 10 grams of gold and\ngo away. There is no exchange of money or gold on March 9th, 2018. After 1 month, you come\nback to the goldsmith pay him Rs.30,450 and collect your gold. This is a forward, where both\nthe parties are obliged to go through with the contract irrespective of the value of the\nunderlying asset (in this case gold) at the point of delivery. Here, in this example, you have\nbought forward or you are long forward, whereas the goldsmith has sold forwards or short\nforwards.\n\n\n## 187",

Any alteration in the terms of the contract is possible if both parties\nagree to it. Corporations, traders and investing institutions extensively use OTC transactions\nto meet their specific requirements. The essential idea of entering into a forward is to fix the\nprice and thereby avoid the price risk. Thus, by entering into forwards, one is assured of the\nprice at which one can buy/sell an underlying asset.\n\n\n## Major limitations of forward contracts\n\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\n\n## As forwards are tailor made contracts i.e. the terms of the contract are according to the\nspecific requirements of the parties, other market participants may not be interested in these\ncontracts. Forwards are not listed or traded on exchanges, which makes it difficult for other\nmarket participants to easily access these contracts or contracting parties.\n\n\n## Counterparty risk\n\n\n## Counterparty risk is the risk of an economic loss from the failure of counterparty to fulfil its\ncontractual obligation. For example, A and B enter into a bilateral agreement, where A will\npurchase 100 kg of rice at Rs.20 per kg from B after 6 months. Here, A is counterparty to B\nand vice versa. After 6 months, if the price of rice is Rs.30 in the market then B may forego his\nobligation to deliver 100 kg of rice at Rs.20 to A. Similarly, if the price of rice falls to Rs.15 then\nA may purchase from the market at a lower price, instead of honouring the contract. Thus, a\nparty to the contract may default on his obligation if there is incentive to default. This risk is\nalso called default risk or credit risk.\n\n\n## In addition to the illiquidity and counterparty risks, there are several issues like lack of\ntransparency, settlement complications as it is to be done directly between the contracting\nparties. Simple solution to all these issues lies in bringing these contracts to the centralized\ntrading platform. This is what futures contracts do.\n\n\n## 10.3.2 Futures\n\n\n# Futures markets were innovated to overcome the limitations of forwards. A futures contract\nis an agreement made through an organized exchange to buy or sell a fixed amount of a\ncommodity or a financial asset on a future date at an agreed price. Simply, futures are\nstandardised forward contracts that are traded on an exchange. Exchange becomes\ncounterparty to both buyer and seller of a futures contract through a clearing house. Futures\ncreate an obligation on both buyer and seller's part. The terms of the contract are specified\nby the exchange and are subjected to change as and when necessary. The clearing corporation\n\n\n## 188",

A trader, who buys\nfutures contract, takes a long position and the one, who sells futures, takes a short position.\nThe words buy and sell are figurative only because no money or underlying asset changes\nhands, between buyer and seller, when the deal is signed.\n\n\n# Features of futures contract\n\n\n# In the futures market, exchange decides all the contract terms of the contract other than\nprice. Accordingly, futures contracts have the following features:\n\n- Contract between two parties is through Exchange\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Centralised trading platform i.e. exchange\n\n\n## Price discovery through free interaction of buyers and sellers\n\n- Margins are payable by both the parties\n\n\n## ·\n\n\n## Quality decided today (standardized)\n\n- Quantity decided today (standardized)\n\n\n## 10.3.3 Options\n\n\n# An Option is a contract that gives its buyers the right, but not an obligation, to buy or sell the\nunderlying asset on or before a stated date/day, at a stated price, for a premium (price). The\nparty taking a long position i.e. buying the option is called buyer/ holder of the option and the\nparty taking a short position i.e. selling the option is called the seller/ writer of the option.\nThe option buyer has the right but no obligation with regards to buying or selling the\nunderlying asset, while the option writer has the obligation to its commitment in the contract.\nTherefore, option buyer/ holder will exercise his option only when the situation is favourable\nto her, but, when she decides to exercise, option writer is legally bound to honour the\ncontract. Options are of mainly two types-Call and Put:\n\n\n## Option, which gives buyer a right to buy the underlying asset, is called Call option and the\noption which gives buyer a right to sell the underlying asset, is called Put option.\n\n\n## The options can be given names like In-The-Money, At-The-Money, and Out-of-The-Money,\ndepending on whether the strike price of the option is greater, equal, or lesser than the\nunderlying asset's market price, respectively. When the underlying asset's price is greater\nthan the strike price, in the case of a call option, the investor would benefit by exercising the\noption and buy the asset at the strike price, and immediately sell it in the market at a higher\nprice to enjoy the gain. In the same manner there is no gain in the case of At-The-Money and\nthere would be a loss in the case of Out-Of-the-Money.\n\n\n## Similarly, there are two connotations of value, namely intrinsic value and time value. Time\nvalue is the excess price a buyer of an option is ready to pay over and above the intrinsic value\n\n\n## 189",

This is with an intention that the value of the option would increase in the\nfuture, especially when there is adequate time for maturity. Intrinsic value is the excess of the\ncurrent price over and above the strike price. Essentially In-The-Money options have positive\nintrinsic value and hence can generate gains for option holders.\n\n\n## 10.3.4 Swaps\n\n\n## A swap is a contract in which two parties agree to a specified exchange of cash flows on a\nfuture date(s). Interest Rate Swaps and Currency Swaps are most common swaps.\n\n\n# Example:\n\n\n## A borrower has to pay a quarterly interest rate defined as the Treasury bill rate on that date,\nplus a spread. This floating rate interest payment means that the actual obligation of the\nborrower will depend on what the Treasury bill rate would be over the period under\nconsideration e.g. six months or one year. The borrower however prefers to pay a fixed rate\nof interest.\n\n\n## She can use the interest rate swap markets to get into the following swap arrangement:\n\n\n## Pay a fixed rate to the swap dealer every quarter\n\n\n## Receive T-bill plus spread from the swap dealer every quarter\n\n\n## The swap in this contract is that one party pays a fixed rate to the other, and receives a floating\nrate in return. The principal amount on which the interest will be computed is agreed upon\nbetween counterparties and is never exchanged. Only the interest rate on this amount is\nexchanged on each settlement date (every quarter) between counterparties. The principal\namount is also known as notional amount.\n\n\n## The borrower will use the floating rate that she has received from the swap market and pay\nthe floating rate dues on her borrowing. These two legs are thus cancelled, and her net\nobligation is the payment of a fixed interest rate to the swap dealer. By using the swap market,\nthe borrower has converted his floating rate borrowing into a fixed rate obligation.\n\n\n# Swaps are very common in currency and interest rate markets. Though swap transactions are\nOTC, they are governed by rules and regulations accepted by Swap Dealer Associations.\nRole of FIMMDA\n\n\n## FIMMDA stands for The Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India\n(FIMMDA). It is an Association of Commercial Banks, Financial Institutions and Primary\nDealers. FIMMDA is a voluntary market body for the bond, Money and Derivatives Markets.\n\n\n# The objectives of FIMMDA are:\n\n\n## 190\n\n\n<!-- Page 191 -->\n\n- To function as the principal interface with the regulators on various issues that impact\nthe functioning of bond, money and derivatives markets.\n- To undertake developmental activities, such as, introduction of benchmark rates and\nnew derivatives instruments, etc.\n- To provide training and development support to dealers and support personnel at\nmember institutions.\n- To adopt/develop international standard practices and a code of conduct in the above\nfields of activity.\n- To devise standardized best market practices.\n- To function as an arbitrator for disputes, if any, between member institutions.\n- To develop standardized sets of documentation.\n- To assume any other relevant role facilitating smooth and orderly functioning of the\nsaid markets.\n\n\n## 10.4 Structure of derivative markets\n\n\n## A derivative market is formed when different market players interested to manage their price\nrisks come together and try to secure themselves from the prospective risks that they fear.\n\n\n## In India the following derivative products are available: indices, stocks, interest rates and\ncommodities. Apart from the above, forward markets for agricultural commodities and swap\nmarkets for interest rates are available in the OTC markets.\n\n\n## OTC Markets\n\n\n## Some derivative contracts are settled between counterparties on terms mutually agreed\nupon between them. These are called over the counter (OTC) derivatives. They are non-\nstandard and they depend on the trust between counterparties to meet their commitment as\npromised. These are prevalent only between institutions, which are comfortable dealing with\neach other.\n\n\n# Exchange Traded Markets\n\n\n## Exchange-traded derivatives are standard derivative contracts defined by an exchange, and\nare usually settled through a clearing house. The buyers and sellers maintain margins with\nthe clearing-house, which enables players that do not know one another (anonymous) to\nenter into contracts on the strength of the settlement process of the clearing house. Forwards\nare OTC derivatives; futures are exchange-traded derivatives.\n\n\n## 10.5 Purpose of Derivatives\n\n\n## A derivative is a risk management product used commonly in financial investments where\nthere is market-based price risk due resulting in an unknown future value of the investment.\nDerivatives are typically used for three purposes—Hedging, Speculation and Arbitrage.\n\n\n## 191",

It simply involves implementation of an investment or trading strategy\nbased on a view about the future prices of the relevant asset underlying the specific derivative\nproduct. For instance, a buyer of a futures contract carries the view that the price of the\nunderlying asset would move up, and she would gain having bought the futures contract at a\nlower price, as of now, because such a view is not reflecting in the current futures price. In\nthe process the investor has to bear the cost of this long position, which is related to cost\nincurred in the management of margins required in the futures contracts.\n\n\n## Arbitrage\n\n\n## The law of one price states that two goods (assets) that are identical, cannot trade at different\nprices in two different markets. If not, one would buy from the cheaper market and sell at the\ncostlier market, and make riskless profits. However, such buying and selling itself will reduce\nthe gap in prices. The demand in the cheaper market will increase prices there and the supply\ninto the costlier market will reduce prices, bringing the prices in both markets to the same\nlevel. Arbitrageurs are specialists who identify such price differential in two markets and\nindulge in trades that reduce such differences in price. Prices in two markets for the same\ntradable asset will be different only to the extent of transaction costs. These costs can include\ntransportation, storage, insurance, interest costs and any other cost that impacts the\nactivities of buying and selling.\n\n\n## 10.6 Benefits, Costs and risks of Derivatives\n\n\n# The applications of derivatives in hedging, speculation and arbitrage demonstrates the\nfollowing key benefits of derivative:\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Enables hedging and better management of risk, by providing various alternative ways\nto structure symmetrical and asymmetrical pay offs.\n\n\n## Enhances the liquidity of underlying markets and reduce overall costs of trading for\ncash and derivatives.\n\n- Increases participation, information dissemination and price discovery.\n\n\n# Market Participants must understand that derivatives, being leveraged instruments, have\nrisks like counterparty risk (default by counterparty), price risk (loss on position because of\nprice move), liquidity risk (inability to exit from a position), legal or regulatory risk\n\n\n## 192",

A market participant should therefore carefully\nconsider whether such trading is suitable for him/her based on these parameters. Market\nparticipants, who trade in derivatives are advised to carefully read the Model Risk Disclosure\nDocument, given by the broker to his clients at the time of signing agreement. Model Risk\nDisclosure Document is issued by the members of Exchanges and contains important\ninformation on trading in Equities and F&O Segments of exchanges. All prospective\nparticipants should read this document before trading on Capital Market/Cash Segment or\nF&O segment of the Exchanges.\n\n\n## 10.7 Equity, Currency and Commodity derivatives\n\n\n## The basic concept of a derivative contract remains the same for all the underlying assets,\nwhether the underlying happens to be a commodity or currency. When the underlying asset\nis a commodity, e.g. Oil or Wheat, the contract is termed a \"commodity derivative”. When\nthe underlying is an exchange rate, the contract is termed a \"currency derivative\". Both future\nand options contracts are available on commodities and as well as on currencies.\n\n\n## Commodity derivatives\n\n\n## Derivatives have become an integral part of today's commodity trading and are used for\nvarious types of risk protection and in innovative investment strategies. Commodity\nderivatives markets play an increasingly important role in the commodity market value chain\nby performing key economic functions such as risk management through risk reduction and\nrisk transfer, price discovery and transactional efficiency. Commodity derivatives markets\nallow market participants such as farmers, traders, processors, etc. to hedge their risk against\nprice volatility through commodity futures and options.\n\n\n## Commodity Futures contracts are highly uniform and are well-defined. These contracts\nexplicitly state the commodities (quantity and quality of the goods) that have to be delivered\nat a certain time and place (acceptable delivery date) in a certain manner (method for closing\nthe contract) and define their permissible price fluctuations (minimum and maximum daily\nprice changes). Therefore, a commodity futures contract is a standardized contract to buy or\nsell commodities for a particular price and for delivery on a certain date in the future.\nFor instance, if a Biscuit manufacturer wants to buy 10 tonnes of wheat today, he can buy the\nwheat in the spot market for immediate use. If he wants to buy 10 tonnes of wheat for future\nuse, he can buy wheat futures contracts at a commodity futures exchange. The futures\ncontracts provide for the delivery of a physical commodity at the originally contracted price\nat a specified future date, irrespective of the actual price prevailing on the actual date of\ndelivery.\n\n\n## 193",

Futures trading in commodities is organized by these exchanges after\nobtaining a certificate of registration from the SEBI. The national exchanges in which\ncommodity derivatives are currently traded in India are: Multi Commodity Exchange of India\nLimited (MCX), National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX), Indian\nCommodity Exchange Limited (ICEX), National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE) and BSE\nLimited (Bombay Stock Exchange).\n\n\n## Commodities that are traded on Indian exchanges can be grouped into four major categories:\nBullion, Metals, Energy and Agriculture.\n\n\n## Currency derivatives\n\n\n## Unlike any other traded asset class, the most significant part of the currency market is the\nconcept of currency pairs. In the currency market, while initiating a trade you buy one\ncurrency and sell another currency. Every trade in FX market is a currency pair: one currency\nis bought with or sold for another currency. In case of currency derivatives, the underlying is\nan exchange rate. Currency risks could be managed through any of the currency derivatives\ni.e. forwards, futures, swaps and options. Each of these instruments has its role in managing\nthe currency risk.\n\n\n## A currency future, also known as FX future, is a futures contract to exchange one currency for\nanother at a specified date in the future at a price (exchange rate) that is fixed on the purchase\ndate. Currency Options are contracts that grant the buyer of the option the right, but not the\nobligation, to buy or sell underlying currency at a specified exchange rate during a specified\nperiod of time. For this right, the buyer pays a premium to the seller of the option.\n\n\n## Currency Derivatives are available on four currency pairs viz. US Dollars (USD), Euro (EUR),\nGreat Britain Pound (GBP) and Japanese Yen (JPY). Cross Currency Futures & Options\ncontracts on EUR-USD, GBP-USD and USD-JPY are also available for trading in Currency\nDerivatives segment.\n\n\n## 10.8 Derivative markets, products and strategies\n\n\n## Derivative trading was introduced in India in June 2000and turnover has increased\ndramatically since then. India's equity derivative markets are thus among the largest in the\nworld.\n\n\n## Pricing a Futures Contract\n\nThe pricing of a futures contract is based on the simple principle of carry cost. Suppose a stock\n\n\n## is selling for Rs.100 in the spot equity markets today. We can buy this stock in the spot market\nand the price to be paid is the spot price (S).\n\n\n## 194",

Let us say the stock future is selling for Rs. 120,\ndelivery date being 20 days away. This is the futures price of the same stock (F).\n\n\n# The difference between the two prices is nothing but the interest rate on the money for those\n20 days. Therefore, the relationship between the two can be shown as:\n\n\n## 120=100+ (interest for 20 days)\n\n\n## F=S+\n\n\n## carry costs\n\n\n## The logic for such pricing is that given the same amount of information about the stock at a\npoint in time, there is no arbitrage profit to be made between the spot and the futures\nmarket. The law of one price stipulates that if the same good is traded in two markets, the\nprice has to be the same, unless there are costs involved in buying in one market and selling\nin another. The presence of these costs makes it impossible to make money by buying the\nsame good in one market and selling it at another.\n\n\n# If the spot price is Rs. 100 and the futures price is Rs. 120, traders would like to buy spot and\nsell futures, to take advantage of the difference in price. However, if the cost of borrowing\nfunds to buy spot and repay the borrowing after selling the futures, is equal to Rs. 20, there\n\n\n## is no profit in the trade.\n\n\n## The difference between the spot and the futures price thus adjusts to the market rates of\ninterest, for the period between spot and futures delivery. This interest is called as 'carry cost'.\n\nThe carry cost is not a risk-free rate or a fixed interest rate, but a market-driven rate that is\n\ndriven by the risk assumed by the lenders to the trading position.\n\n\n## The difference between the spot price and the futures price is called basis. If futures trade at\na level higher than spot prices, the basis is positive. The gains to the trader will be equal to\nthe difference between the two prices. If the trader's cost of carry is different from the basis,\nthere is arbitrage profit to be made on the basis.\n\n\n## After the trade, the spot and future prices are bound to change. However, given that opposite\npositions have been locked into, that net position will remain unaltered on settlement date.\n\n\n## On settlement date, both the spot and the futures are at the same level. This is known as the\nspot-future convergence. The carry cost of buying spot and selling futures on settlement date\nis zero, since settlement is on the same day as the contract expiration day. Therefore, on\nexpiration day, spot and future prices of the same underlying is identical.\n\n\n## Spot-Future Arbitrage\n\n\n## Sometimes the spot price and the futures price for the same stock vary much more than what\nis justified by a normal rate of interest (cost of carry). There is then the scope to create equal\nbut opposite positions in the cash and futures market (arbitrage) using lower cost funds.\n\n\n## 195",

Investors who may not\nwant to invest directly in financial markets may instead get exposure to the same securities\nthrough a mutual fund.\n\n\n## There are multiple entities involved in the activities of a mutual fund business. All these\nentities are regulated by SEBI for their eligibility in terms of experience and financial\nsoundness, range of responsibilities and accountability. A mutual fund is set up by a sponsor,\nwho is its promoter. Trustees are appointed to take care of the interests of the investors in\nthe various schemes launched by the mutual fund. An asset management company (AMC) is\nappointed to manage the activities related to launching a scheme, marketing it, collecting\nfunds, investing the funds according to the scheme's investment objectives and enabling\ninvestor transactions. In this, they are assisted by other entities such as banks, registrars to\nan issue and transfer agents, investor service centres (ISC), brokers or members of stock\nexchanges, custodians, among others.\n\n\n## The AMC creates a product with the approval of the trustees and SEBI. The mutual fund invites\nsubscription from investors by issuing an offer document that gives all details of the proposed\nfund, including its investment objective, investment pattern in different asset classes to\nreflect the objective, the strategy of the fund manager to manage the fund, the costs and fees\nassociated with managing the fund and all other information prescribed by SEBI as essential\nfor an investor to make an investment decision. This is the New Fund Offer (NFO) of the\nscheme.\n\n\n## 199",

The application form along with the abridged offer document called the\nKey Information Memorandum (KIM) is available with the AMC, investor service centres and\nother distribution points, the details of which are available in the KIM. The activities related\nto maintaining investor records and investment details and communicating with the investors\nis done by the R&T agent of the scheme. The documents i.e. Scheme Information Document\n(SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) are available on the website of the AMC.\n\n\n## The funds collected from multiple investors are invested in a portfolio of securities or assets\nthat reflect the stated investment objective of the fund. This portfolio is owned only by the\ninvestors who have contributed the funds, in proportion to their contribution.\n\n\n## 11.2 Concepts and Terms Related to Mutual Funds\n\n\n# 11.2.1 Investment Objective\n\nAn investor's decision to invest in a mutual fund scheme should be determined by the\n\n\n## suitability of the scheme to their needs. A mutual fund scheme is defined by its investment\nobjective. The investment objective states what the scheme intends to achieve. The asset\n\n\n## class that the fund will invest in, the type of securities that will be selected and the way the\nfund will be managed will depend upon the investment objective. The features of the\nportfolio in terms of the level and type of returns and the risks involved in the fund will also\ndepend upon its investment objective.\n\n\n## 11.2.2 Units\n\n\n## Just as an investor's investments in equity of a company is represented in number of shares,\nor investments in debt is represented in number of bonds or debentures, each investor's\n\n\n## holding in a mutual fund is represented in terms of units that is derived from the amount\ninvested. Each unit represents one share of the fund. For example, A &B invests in GTX Equity\nfund when the price of each unit is Rs.10. A invests Rs.5,000 and B Rs.10,000. The number of\nunits allotted is calculated as amount invested/price per units.\n\n\n## A\n\n\n## :Rs.5,000/Rs.10=500~units\n\n\n## B\n\n\n## :Rs.10.000/Rs.10=1000~units\n\n\n# The units are first offered to the investors at the time the scheme is launched through a new\nfund offer (NFO). Subsequently, depending upon the structure of the scheme, the fund may\nor may not issue fresh units to investors. Units can be allotted in decimals too which ensures\n\n\n## that the investor gets value for their entire investment.\n\n\n## 200\n\n\n<!-- Page 201 -->\n\n\n# 11.2.3 Net Assets\n\n\n# The assets of a mutual fund scheme are the current value of the portfolio of securities held\nby it. There may be some current assets such as cash and receivables. Together they form the\ntotal assets of the scheme. From this, the fees and expenses related to managing the fund\nsuch as fund manager's fees, charges paid to constituents, regulatory expenses on\nadvertisements and such are deducted to arrive at the net assets of the scheme. This belongs\nto the investors in the fund who have been allotted units and no other entity has a claim to\nit.\n\n\n## The Net assets of a scheme will go up whenever investors buy additional units in the scheme\nand bring in funds, or when the value of the investments held in the portfolio goes up, or\nwhen the securities held in the portfolio earns income such as dividends from shares or\ninterest on bonds held. Similarly, the net assets of the scheme will go down if investors take\nout their investments from the scheme by redeeming their units or if the securities held in\nthe portfolio fall in value or when expenses related to the scheme are accounted for. The net\nassets of the scheme are therefore not a fixed value but keep changing with a change in any\nof the above factors.\n\n\n## 11.2.4 Net Asset Value (NAV)\n\n\n## The net asset per unit of a scheme is calculated as Net assets/Number of outstanding units of\nthe scheme. This is the Net asset value (NAV). The NAV of the scheme will change with every\nchange in the Net Assets of the scheme. All investor transactions are conducted at the current\nNAV of the scheme.\n\n\n## For example, NUM Equity Fund collects Rs.100,000 from investors and allots 10,000 units. The\nfunds are invested in a portfolio of securities. Consider the table below.\n\n\n## Value\n\n\n## Net\n\n\n## Units\n\n\n## NAV(Rs)\n\n\n# Assets(Rs) Outstanding A/B\n\n\n## A\n\n\n## 100000\n\n\n## 10000\n\n\n## of 120000\n\n\n## 10000\n\n\n## portfolio goes up\n\n\n## Investor\n\n\n## redeems 1000\n\n\n## units when NAV\n\n\n## is Rs.12\n\n\n## 201\n\n\n## 108000\n\n\n## 9000\n\n\n## B\n\n\n## 10\n\n\n## 127\n\n\n## 127\n\n\n## Comments\n\n\n## An increase in net assets has\n\n\n## led to a rise in NAV.\n\n\n## No\n\n\n## change\n\n\n## decrease\n\n\n## in NAV.A\n\n\n## in net assets\n\n\n## because of investor\n\n\n## redeeming is offset by a",

If an investor\nhas invested 1,000 units in the scheme at Rs.10, the value of the investment is Rs.10,000.\nWhen the NAV goes up to Rs.12, the value of the investment also goes up to Rs.12,000 and\nwhen the NAV goes down to Rs.11.11 the value of the investment comes down to Rs.11,110.\nA redemption or additional investment will not directly affect the NAV since the transactions\nare conducted at the NAV. In the above example, consider the impact if hypothetically the\ninvestor buying 1,000 units when the NAV is Rs.11.11, is allotted units at the face value of\nRs.10. The investor will bring in Rs.10,000 (100* Rs.10). The net assets will go up by this\nRs. 10,000 to Rs.110,000. The number of units outstanding will go up by 1,000 to 10,000 units.\nThe NAV post this transaction will be Rs.11. The NAV of the scheme has come down because\nthe units were allotted at a price different from the NAV and will have an impact on all the\ninvestors in the scheme. The NAV of a scheme (other than liquid schemes where NAV is\ncalculated on a daily basis) is calculated every business day so that investors can value their\nportfolio holdings and conduct transactions on this basis.\n\n\n## 11.2.5 Cut off timings\n\n\n## The time when a request for a purchase or redemption or switch of units is received by a\nmutual fund will determine when it is processed. This is a standard that is followed across all\nmutual funds so that there is equity and fairness in allocation and that no investors gets a\npreferential treatment over others. The NAV that will be applicable would thus be determined\nby the time when the request is received by the mutual fund, provided clear funds hit the\naccount of the fund by cut-off time.\n\n\n## 11.2.6 Mark to Market\n\n\n# The current value of the portfolio forms the base of the net assets of the scheme and\ntherefore the NAV. It means that if the portfolio was to be liquidated, then this would be the\nvalue that would be realised and distributed to the investors. Therefore, the portfolio has to\nreflect the current market price of the securities held. This process of valuing the portfolio on\n\n\n## 202",

An open-\nended scheme allows investors to invest in additional units and redeem investment\ncontinuously at current NAV. The scheme is for perpetuity unless the investors decide to wind\nup the scheme. The unit capital of the scheme is not fixed but changes with every investment\nor redemption made by investors.\n\n\n## A closed-end scheme is for a fixed period or tenor. It offers units to investors only during the\nnew fund offer (NFO). The scheme is closed for transactions with investors after this. The units\nallotted are redeemed by the fund at the prevalent NAV when the term is over and the fund\nceases to exist after this. In the interim, if investors want to exit their investment they can do\nso by selling the units to other investors on a stock exchange where they are mandatorily\nlisted. The unit capital of a closed end fund does not change over the life of the scheme since\ntransactions between investors on the stock exchange does not affect the fund. AUM at MTM\nwill change.\n\n\n## 11.3.2. Interval funds\n\n\n## Interval funds are a variant of closed end funds which become open-ended during specified\nperiods. During these periods investors can purchase and redeem units like in an open-ended\nfund. The specified transaction periods are for a minimum period of two days and there must\nbe a minimum gap of 15 days between two transaction periods. Like closed-ended funds,\nthese funds have to be listed on a stock exchange.\n\n\n# 11.3.3 Exchange Traded Funds\n\n\n## Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are mutual funds that have the features of a mutual fund but\ncan be traded. Like a stock they are listed on the stock exchange so they can be traded all day\nlong. Beneath this feature is the fact that the ETF is a mutual fund that has its value derived\nfrom the value of the holdings in its portfolio. ETFs usually track some index when it comes to\nequity-oriented funds while they can also track the price of a commodity like gold. Instead of\na single NAV for a day that the investor gets in a normal open-ended fund there are multiple\nprices they can get in an ETF. In an ETF it is actually investors trading with each other while in\ncase of an open-ended fund it is the investor on one side of the transaction and the mutual\nfund on the other side.\n\n\n## 203",

SEBI's Regulations called the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996, along with\namendments made from time to time, govern the setting up a mutual fund and its structure,\nlaunching a scheme, creating and managing the portfolio, investor protection, investor\nservices and roles and responsibilities of the constituents.\n\n\n## Apart from SEBI, other regulators such as the RBI are also involved for specific areas which\ninvolve foreign exchange transactions such as investments in international markets and\ninvestments by foreign nationals and the role of the banking system in the mutual funds\nindustry in India.\n\n\n## The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) is the industry body that oversees the\nfunctioning of the industry and recommends best practices to be followed by the industry\nmembers.

Timelines for allotment of units in NFOs, scheme opening for continuous\ntransactions, confirmation of unit allotment etc. have been defined by SEBI.\n\n\n# 11.5 Mutual Fund Products\n\n\n## SEBI has defined the process of categorizing open-end mutual fund products broadly as equity\nschemes, debt schemes, hybrid schemes, solution-oriented schemes and other schemes.\n\n\n## Open-ended schemes are classified based on the asset class/sub-asset class, the strategy\nadopted to select and manage the schemes or the solutions offered by the scheme.\n\n\n## Only one scheme per category is permitted for each mutual fund. The exceptions are Index\nfunds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) tracking different indices, Fund of Funds with\ndifferent underlying schemes and sectoral/thematic funds investing in different sectors or\nthemes.\n\n\n## 204",

Since the\nportfolio comprises of the equity instruments, the risk and return from the scheme will be\nsimilar to directly investing in equity markets. Equity funds can be further categorized on the\nbasis of the strategy adopted by the fund managers to manage the fund.\n\n- Passive & Active Funds\n\n\n## Passive funds invest the money in the companies represented in an index such as Nifty or\nSensex in the same proportion as the company's representation in the index. There is no\nselection of securities or investment decisions taken by the fund manager as to when to invest\nor how much to invest in each security. Active funds select stocks for the portfolio based on\na strategy that is intended to generate higher return than the index. Active funds can be\nfurther categorized based on the way the securities for the portfolio are selected.\n\n- Diversified Equity funds\n\n\n## Diversified equity funds invest across segments, sectors and sizes of companies. Since the\nportfolio takes exposure to different stocks across sectors and market segments, there is a\nlower risk in such funds of poor performance of few stocks or sectors. Some equity diversified\nfunds can also be closed ended schemes which are in operation for a specific time period. The\nassets are redeemed after the time period of the scheme is over and returned to the\ninvestors.\n\n- Based on market capitalisation\n\n\n## Equity funds may focus on a particular size of companies to benefit from the features of such\ncompanies.\n\n\n# Equity stocks may be segmented based on market capitalization as large- cap, mid-cap and\nsmall-cap stocks. The open-end equity schemes (based on market capitalisation) are classified\nby SEBI as follows:\n\n- Large cap funds invest in stocks of large, liquid blue-chip companies with stable\nperformance and returns. Large-cap companies are those ranked 1 to 100th in terms\nof full market capitalization in the list of stocks prepared by AMFI. To be classified as\na large cap fund, at least 80% of the total assets should be invested in such large cap\ncompanies.\n- Mid-cap funds invest in mid-cap companies that have the potential for faster growth\nand higher returns. These companies are more susceptible to economic downturns\nand therefore, evaluating and selecting the right companies becomes important.\nFunds that invest in such companies have a higher risk of the companies selected not\nbeing able to withstand the slowdown in revenues and profits.

To be classified as a large and mid-cap fund, a minimum of\n35% of the total assets should be invested in large cap companies and a minimum of\n35% in mid-cap companies.\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Small-cap funds invest in companies with small market capitalisation with intent of\nbenefitting from the higher gains in the price of stocks. The risks are also higher.\nCompanies ranked from 251 onwards in terms of total market capitalization in the list\nof stocks prepared by AMFI are defined as small-cap companies. To be classified as a\nsmall cap fund, at least 65% of the total assets should be invested in such companies.\n• Multi cap funds invest across large, mid and small cap companies. Earlier to be\nclassified as a multi cap fund at least 65% of the total assets should be invested in\nequity related instruments of such companies. At least 75% of the assets to be\ninvested in equity related instruments with a minimum of 25 % in large caps, 25% in\nmid-caps and 25% in small caps.\n\n- In Flexicap funds there is no minimum investment limits across market caps and the\nfunds are free to invest according to their requirements. Overall at least 65% of the\ncorpus has to be invested in equities.\n- Based on Sectors and Industries\n\n\n## Sector funds invest in companies that belong to a particular sector such as technology or\nbanking. The risk is higher because of lesser diversification since such funds are concentrated\nin a particular sector. Sector performances tend to be cyclical and the return from investing\nin a sector is never the same across time. For example, Auto sector, does well, when the\neconomy is doing well and more cars, trucks and bikes are bought. It does not do well, when\ndemand goes down. Banking sector does well, when interest rates are low in the market; they\ndon't do well when rates are high. Investments in sector funds have to be timed well.\nInvestment in sector funds should be made when the fund manager expects the related\nsectors, to do well. They could out-perform the market, if the call on sector performance plays\nout. In case it doesn't, such funds could underperform the broad market. An open-ended\nsector fund should invest at least 80% of the total assets in the equity and equity-related\ninstruments of the identified sector.

They are more diversified than sector funds but still have a high\nconcentration risks. An open-end thematic fund should invest at least 80% of the total assets\nin the equity and equity-related instruments of the identified sector.\n\n\n## Under Thematic Category of mutual funds, any scheme under the ESG category can be\nlaunched with one of the following strategies - a. Exclusion b. Integration c. Best-in-class\n& Positive Screening d. Impact investing e. Sustainable objectives f. Transition or transition\nrelated investments.\n\n- Based on Investment Style\n\n\n# The strategy adopted by the fund manager to create and manage the fund's portfolio is a\nbasis for categorizing funds. The investment style and strategy adopted can significantly\nimpact the nature of risk and return in the portfolio. Passive fund invests only in the securities\nincluded in an index and does not feature selection risks. However, the returns from the fund\nwill also be only in line with the market index. On the other hand, active funds use selection\nand timing strategies to create portfolios that are expected to generate returns better than\nthe market returns. The risk is higher too since the fund's performance will be affected\nnegatively if the selected stocks do not perform as expected. The open-ended equity funds\n(based on strategies and styles for selection of securities) are classified by SEBI as follows:\n\n- Value Funds seek to identify companies that are trading at prices below their inherent\nvalue with the expectation of benefiting from an increase in price as the market\nrecognizes the true value. Such funds have lower risk. They require a longer\ninvestment horizon for the strategy to play out. At least 65% of the total assets of the\nvalue fund should be invested in equity and equity-related instruments.\n- Contra Funds adopt a contrarian investment strategy. They seek to identify under-\nvalued stocks and stocks that are under-performing due to transitory factors. The fund\ninvests in such stocks at valuations that are seen as cheap relative to their long-term\nfundamental values. Mutual fund houses can either offer a contra fund or a value\nfund. An AMC can have either of Value or Contra Fund, not both.\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Dividend yield funds invest in stocks that have a high dividend yield. These stocks pay\na large portion of their profits as dividend and these appeals to investors looking for\nincome from their equity investments. The companies typically have high level of\nstable earnings but do not have much potential for growth or expansion. They\ntherefore pay high dividends while the stock prices remain stable. The stocks are\nbought for their dividend pay-out rather than for the potential for capital appreciation.\n\n\n## 207",

The risk in such funds may be higher because\nthe extent of diversification in the portfolio is lower.\n\n- Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS)\n\n\n## ELSS is a special type of open-end equity fund scheme which provides the investor with the\ntax deduction benefits under section 80C of the Income Tax Act up to a limit of Rs.1,50,000\nper year provided the investor is filing under old tax regime. An ELSS must hold at least 80%\nof the portfolio in equity securities. The investment made by the investor is locked-in for a\nperiod of three years during which it cannot be redeemed, transferred or pledged.\n\n\n# 11.5.2 Debt Funds\n\n\n## Debt funds invest in government bonds, corporate bonds, and money market securities,\nearning predefined coupon income. Government bonds are risk-free and highly liquid but\noffer lower returns, while corporate bonds carry credit risk and pay higher coupons.\n\n\n## Fund managers assess credit risk using ratings—higher ratings indicate lower default risk.\nBorrowers issue short- and long-term debt based on funding needs. Debt instrument prices\nfluctuate with interest rate changes, with longer-tenor bonds being more sensitive. Fund\nmanagers balance credit and interest rate risks to optimize returns based on fund objectives\nand market conditions.\n\n\n## Debt funds can be categorized based on the type of securities they hold in the portfolio, in\nterms of tenor and credit risk.\n\n\n# The open-ended debt schemes (investing in securities with maturity ranging from one day to\none year) are classified by SEBI as follows:\n\n\n## •\n\nOvernight Funds invest in securities with a maturity of one day.\n\n- Liquid Funds invest in debt securities with less than 91 days to maturity.\n- Ultra Short Duration Funds invest in debt and money market instruments such that\n\nthe Macaulay duration of the portfolio is between 3 months and 6 months.\n\n- Low Duration Fund invest in debt and money markets instruments such that the\nMacaulay duration of the fund is between 6 months to 12 months.\n- Money Market Fund invest in money market instruments having maturity up to one\nyear.\n\n\n## The next category of debt funds combines short term debt securities with a small allocation\nto longer term debt securities.

Fund managers take a call on the\nexposure to long term securities based on their view for interest rate movements. If interest\nrates are expected to go down, these funds increase their exposure to long term securities to\nbenefit from the resultant increase in prices. The volatility in returns will depend upon the\nextent of long-term debt securities in the portfolio.\n\n\n# Short term funds may provide a higher level of return than liquid funds and ultra-short term\nfunds, but will be exposed to higher mark to market risks. Open-ended debt schemes\ninvesting in the above stated manner are categorised by SEBI in the following manner:\n\n\n## ·\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## Short duration funds invest in debt and money market instruments such that the\nMacaulay duration of the fund is between 1 year-3 years.\n\n\n## Medium duration fund invests in debt and money market instruments such that the\nMacaulay duration of the fund is between 3 years- 4 years.\n\n\n## Medium to Long duration fund invests in debt and money market instruments such\nthat the Macaulay duration of the fund is between 4 years- 7 years.\n\n\n## If the fund manager has a view on interest rates in the event of anticipated adverse situations, then\nthe portfolio's Macaulay duration may be reduced to one year for Medium and Medium to Long\nduration funds.\n\n\n# Long Term Debt Funds\n\n\n## Long term debt funds are structured to generate total returns made up of both interest\nincome and capital appreciation from the securities held. Since the price of securities may go\nup or down resulting in gains or losses, the total returns tend to be more volatile than short\nterm debt funds that focus primarily on earning coupon income.\n\n\n## The value of bond held in a long-term portfolio, changes with change in interest rates. Since\nmarket interest rates and value of a bond are inversely related, any fall in the interest rates\ncauses a mark-to-market gain in a bond portfolio and vice versa.\n\n\n## Therefore, in a falling interest rate scenario, when investors in most fixed income products\nface a reduced rate of interest income, long term debt funds post higher returns. This is\nbecause the interest income is augmented by capital gains and result in a higher total return.\n\n\n## The extent of change in market prices of debt securities is linked to the average tenor of the\nportfolio - higher the tenor, greater the impact of changes in interest rates. Long term debt\nfunds choose the tenor of the instruments for the portfolio, and manage the average maturity\nof the portfolio, based on scheme objectives and their own interest rate views.\n\n\n## Corporate debt securities enable higher interest income due to the credit risk associated with\nthem.

There is no risk of default and liquidity is considerably higher in case\nof government securities. However, prices of government securities are very sensitive\nto interest rate changes. Long term gilt funds have a longer maturity and therefore,\nhigher interest rate risk as compared to short term gilt funds. Gilt funds are popular\nwith investors mandated to invest in G-secs such as provident funds or PF trusts.\n\n- Gilt funds with 10-year constant duration invest a minimum of 80% of total assets in\ngovernment securities such that the Macaulay duration of the portfolio is equal to 10\n\n\n## years.\n\n- Dynamic bond funds seek flexible and dynamic management of interest rate risk and\ncredit risk. That is, these funds have no restrictions with respect to security types or\nmaturity profiles that they invest in. Dynamic or flexible debt funds do not focus on\nlong or short term segment of the yield curve, but move across the yield curve\ndepending on where they see the opportunity for exploiting changes in yields duration\nof these portfolios are not fixed, but are dynamically managed. If the manager believes\nthat interest rates could move up, the duration of the portfolio is reduced and vice\nversa. According to SEBI Categorisation, an open-end dynamic bond fund invests\nacross durations.\n\n\n## The open-end floating rate funds invest a minimum of 65% of total assets in floating rate debt\ninstruments. In these instruments the coupon is not fixed for the term of the instrument but\nis periodically revised with reference to the market rate. If interest rates in the markets go\nup, the coupon for these instruments are also revised upwards and vice versa. The reset\nperiod is defined when the bond is issued, say every 6 months, as also the market benchmark\nwhich will be referred to determine current rates. Since the coupon of the bond will be in line\nwith the market rates, there is low interest rate risk in the bonds.\n\n\n## 210\n\n\n<!-- Page 211 -->\n\n\n# Fixed maturity plans (FMPs) are closed-end funds that invest in debt securities with\nmaturities that match the term of the scheme. The debt securities are redeemed on maturity\nand paid to investors. FMPs are issued for various maturity periods ranging from 3 months to\n5 years.\n\n\n# Target Maturity Funds have a defined maturity date, are open-ended i.e. can be purchased\nfrom redeemed with the AMC, and have a wider maturity range than FMPs. TMFs with\nmaturity of 3 to 15 years have been floated. Both FMPs and TMFs have maturity roll-down\ni.e. with every passing day, the residual or remaining maturity comes down.\n\n\n## Mutual fund companies typically keep FMPs in the pipeline, issuing one after another,\nparticularly depending upon demand from corporate investors in the market. The return of\nan FMP depends on the yield it earns on the underlying securities. The investments may be\nspread across various issuers, but the tenor is matched with the maturity of the plan. An FMP\nstructure eliminates the interest rate risk or price risk for investors if the fund is held passively\nuntil maturity. Therefore, even if the price of bonds held in the portfolio moves up or down,\nas long as the fund receives the interest pay-outs and the original investment on maturity,\nthe FMP does not suffer significant risks. This makes FMPs the preferred investment in a rising\ninterest rate environment, as investors can lock into high yields.\n\n\n# 11.5.3 Hybrid Funds\n\n\n# Hybrid funds invest in a combination of debt and equity securities. The allocation to each of\nthese asset classes will depend upon the investment objective of the scheme. The risk and\nreturn in the scheme will depend upon the allocation to equity and debt and how they are\nmanaged. A higher allocation to equity instruments will increase the risk and the expected\nreturns from the portfolio. Similarly, if the debt instruments held are short term in nature for\ngenerating income, then the extent of risk is lower than if the portfolio holds long-term debt\ninstruments that show greater volatility in prices. SEBI has classified open-end hybrid funds\nas follows:\n\n\n## Conservative hybrid funds invest minimum of 75% to 90% in a debt portfolio and 10%\nto 25% of total assets in equity and equity-related instruments. The debt component\nis conservatively managed with the focus on generating regular income, which is\ngenerally paid out in the form of periodic dividend. The credit risk and interest rate\nrisk are taken care of by investing into liquid, high credit rated and short-term debt\nsecurities. The allocation to equity is kept low and primarily in large cap stocks, to\nenable a small increase in return, without the high risk of fluctuation in NAV. These\nattributes largely contribute accrual income in order to provide regular dividends.\nDebt-oriented hybrids are designed to be a low-risk product for an investor. These\nproducts are suitable for traditional debt investors, who are looking for an opportunity\nto participate in equity markets on a conservative basis with limited equity exposure.\nThese funds are taxed as debt funds.\n\n\n## 211",

Usually, they take short (contra) positions\nin the equity component to reduce net equity exposure, but maintain more than 65%\nlong equity for taxation purpose.\n- Multi Asset Allocation Funds invest in at least three asset classes with a minimum of\n10% of the total assets invested in each of the asset classes. The fund manager takes\na view on which type of investment is expected to do well and will tilt the allocation\ntowards either asset class. Within this, foreign securities will not be treated as\nseparate asset class.\n- Arbitrage funds aim at taking advantage of the price differential between the cash\nand the derivatives markets. Arbitrage is defined as simultaneous purchase and sale of\nan asset to take advantage of difference in prices in different markets. The difference\nbetween the future and the spot price of the same underlying is an interest element,\nrepresenting the interest on the amount invested in spot, which can be realized on a\nfuture date, when the future is sold. Funds buy in the spot market and sell in the\nderivatives market, to earn the interest rate differential.\n- Equity Savings fund invest in equity, debt and arbitrage opportunities to generate\nreturns. A minimum of 65% of total assets will be invested in equity and equity related\ninstruments and a minimum of 10% in debt investments.\n\n\n## Close-end Hybrid Funds\n\n\n## Capital Protection Funds are closed-end hybrids funds. In these types of funds, the exposure\nto equity is typically taken through the equity derivatives market. The portfolio is structured\nsuch that a portion of the principal amount is invested in debt instruments so that it grows to\nthe principal amount over the term of the fund. For example, Rs.90 may be invested for 3\nyears to grow into Rs.100 at maturity, net of expenses. This provides the protection to the\ncapital invested. The remaining portion of the original amount is invested in equity derivatives\nto earn higher returns.\n\n\n# 11.5.4 Solution Oriented Schemes: SEBI has categorised the open-end solution-oriented\nschemes as follows:\n\n\n## 212",

Mutual funds offer investment options for each\nscheme that define how the investor will take the returns from the investment. Most mutual\nfunds offer an Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (earlier known as dividend) option\nand growth option. The Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal option implies that the\nfunds will pay-out the returns generated in the form of periodic dividends. There is an Income\nDistribution cum Capital Withdrawal re-investment option too where the dividend declared\nis not paid out but re-invested in the scheme. The NAV of the scheme will fall to the extent of\nthe dividend that is paid out of its net assets. Investors should know that the amount paid as\ndividend can also include a part of their capital so they should check the breakup of the\namount received. In the growth option, the returns generated are retained in the scheme and\ntranslates into an appreciation in the NAV, and hence the value of the investment. The\ninvestor can realize this appreciation at any time by redeeming the units.\n\n\n## 11.7 Triggers in Mutual Fund Investment\n\n\n## Another factor to consider are various trigger options that ensure that on achieving a\nparticular situation, the redemption of units are automatically triggered. The trigger can be\nsomething like a specified percentage return over the cost of the investment or it can be a\nspecific value that has been set by the investor. There can be a NAV based trigger, when this\nreaches a certain level the sell decision is automatically made. Another variation is a specific\ndate trigger or an index level trigger, when the index hits a specific level. The setting of the\ncondition ensures that when this is reached the fund will act automatically and redeem or\ntransfer the units. It allows the investor to achieve their aim without having to track the\ninvestment continuously since the trigger conditions are set in advance.\n\n\n## 11.8 Process associated with Investment in Mutual Funds\n\n\n## 11.8.1 Fresh Purchase of Mutual Fund Units\n\n\n## An investor can make an initial investment in a mutual fund either in the new fund offer (NFO)\nor subsequently when the open-ended fund opens for transactions. A fresh purchase of units\nis made by submitting an application form in which mandatory information has to be provided\nsuch as name, date of birth, status, occupation of the first holder, PAN details, address and\ncontact details, signature and bank account details of the first holder. The application form\nprovides for joint holder details to be provided for two joint holders (a folio can have up to\nthree holders) and the mode of holding and operating the folio will have to be provided for\nthe records.\n\n\n## The investment details such as the name of the scheme, option and payment mode have to\nbe filled in. The investor can also make nominations in the application form. The form has to\nbe signed by all the holders, irrespective of the mode of holding chosen. Nowadays physical\nhas been replaced by digital. Instead of physical signature, there are digital authentication\nmethods.\n\n\n## 215",

The\napplication form for purchase of units, along with the payment has to be submitted at the\nAMC's office or the investor service centres.\n\n\n## The units will be allotted to investors at the applicable NAV for the transaction. The applicable\nNAV will depend upon a) type of scheme, b) day of transaction, c) time of making the\napplication, d) availability of clear funds to the mutual fund for all liquid fund purchases and\nfor non-liquid purchases.\n\n\n## 11.8.2 Additional Purchases in a Mutual Fund\n\n\n## Investors can make additional investments in an open-ended scheme after the fresh purchase\nmade in the NFO or continuous offer period. The folio number created at the time of the fresh\npurchase is the unique identity of the investor with the mutual fund under which all personal\ninformation such as name, signature, address, contact details and regulatory compliance on\nPAN and KYC norms are recorded. Quoting the folio number at the time of making the\nadditional purchase eliminates the need for providing all the information again.\n\n\n## 11.8.3 Redemptions from a Mutual Fund\n\n\n## Investments in open-ended schemes of mutual funds can be realized at any time by\nredeeming the units. A redemption request can be for all the units held or for a part of it. The\nredemption request can specify the number of units to be redeemed or the amount in rupees\nto be redeemed. The request may be made using the transaction slip and submitted at any\npoint of acceptance or online. It has to be signed by the holders according to the mode of\nholding registered in the folio. The applicable NAV for valid transactions received on a day is\nthe NAV calculated for the day. The NAV is adjusted for exit load, if any.\n\n\n# The redemption amount is sent either through a cheque with pre-printed details of the first\nholder or credited to the bank account of the first holder registered with the mutual fund.\nThe investor can choose the mode of receiving redemption and other pay-outs, such as\n\n\n## 216",

The IFSC code of the\naccount has to be given to receive the proceeds electronically through ECS, NEFT or direct\ncredit. Direct credit facility is provided only with such banks that the mutual fund has a tie up\nwith. Instant Access Facility (IAF) credits the redemption amount on the day of the\nredemption request from liquid funds for resident individual investors only. The limit for the\nuse of this facility is Rs. 50,000 or 90% of the latest value of investment in the scheme,\nwhichever is lower, per day per scheme per investor.\n\n\n## In case of redemptions by an NRI, the bank account into which the redemption proceeds will\nbe credited will depend upon whether the original investment was made from repatriable\nfunds or domestic funds. If investments were made from an NRO or rupee account,\nredemption proceeds can only be credited to a similar account from which repatriation is\nregulated. If the investment was made from repatriable funds then the redemption proceeds\nwill be credited to an NRO or NRE account specified by the investor.\n\n\n## Mutual funds specify the minimum redemption amount for each transaction. They may also\nspecify the minimum balance to be maintained in the folio. If redemption will result in the\nfolio balance falling below the minimum balance required, mutual funds retain the right to\nredeem all the units held and close the folio.\n\n\n## Mutual funds may restrict redemptions from schemes when there is a systemic crisis or\nevents that constricts market liquidity. This includes situations when the market at large\nbecomes illiquid and it is not restricted to a specific issuer, market failures and closures and\nunexpected operational issues.\n\n\n# In a circular issued in May 2020 SEBI has said that all schemes that are being wound up would\nneed to be listed on the stock exchanges in order to provide an exit route to investors. There\ncan be quite some time before the entire assets of a wound up scheme are realised and given\nto the investors. This facility is meant to provide liquidity to the investors in the interim period.\n11.8.4 Switch\n\n\n## A switch is a single transfer from one scheme or option of a scheme to another mutual fund\nscheme, or option of the same scheme. The investor redeems units from scheme and\nsimultaneously invests it in another scheme of the same mutual fund in an inter-scheme\nswitch. In an intra-scheme switch, the investor redeems from one option of a scheme and\ninvests in another option of the same scheme. In a switch, an investor can transfer all or a\nportion of the funds held in the investment. The applicable NAV for the switch-out\n(redemption) from the source scheme or option and switch-in (purchase) into the target\nscheme or option will depend upon the type of schemes. Since there is a redemption that\nhappens in a switch, exit loads and taxes will apply. The investor will need to specify the\nsource and target schemes and options and the amount to be switched.\n\n\n## 217",

This\nconsists of a process where the dividend that is declared by a mutual fund scheme is actually\nused to purchase more units of the scheme instead of this being received as a pay-out. It is a\nway of ensuring that there is compounding of returns since no amount is taken out of the\ninvestment but it keeps getting invested back. The entire process consists of two transactions\nfor the investor, both of which happen automatically without them having to do anything.\nThe first involves the declaration of the dividend. Once this happens then the second part is\ncompleted, where the amount that is earned as dividend gets converted into new units at the\nNAV post the dividend declaration.\n\n\n# 11.9 Systematic Transactions\n\n\n## Mutual funds offer investors the facility to automate their investment and redemption\ntransactions to meet their needs from the investment. Investors may choose to invest\nperiodically rather than in a lump sum to benefit from volatility in prices, they may choose to\nredeem periodically to generate regular pay-out from the investment or they may want to\nrebalance the portfolio periodically to align or re-align the asset allocation to their situation.\nSystematic investment plans (SIP), systematic withdrawal plans (SWP), systematic transfer\nplans (STP) and switches are some of the facilities provided.\n\n\n# Systematic transactions require investors to commit to a set of transactions in advance. The\nvalue of each investment, the periodicity of the transaction and the day of execution\ntransaction will be decided at the time of commitment. The transaction will be executed at\nthe applicable NAV at the time of execution of each transaction. Systematic transactions\nwhich have been initiated can be cancelled at any time by the investor after giving due notice.\n11.9.1 Systematic Investment Plans (SIP)\n\n\n## In a systematic investment plan, investors commit to invest a fixed sum of money at regular\nintervals over a period of time in a mutual fund scheme. It enables investors to build a corpus\nover time even with small sums invested. Through SIP, investment is made at different prices\nover the term chosen and this allows investors to benefit from the volatility in the market.\nSince the same amount is being invested in each instalment, investors buy more units when\nthe price is low and less units when the price is high. Overtime, the average cost of acquisition\nper unit comes down. This is called rupee cost averaging and is the primary advantage that\nSIPs provides investors.\n\n\n## 218",

This is usually lower than the\nminimum amount of investment for a lump sum investment.\n- The periodicity of the investment: The intervals at which the investment can be made,\nsay monthly or quarterly, is defined by the mutual fund. Investors can choose the\nperiodicity that is most suitable.\n- The date of investment each period: The investor has to choose the dates from those\nspecified by the mutual fund for the monthly/quarterly instalment.\n- The tenor of the plan: The date of commencement of the SIP and the term over which\nthe SIP will run has to be selected by the investor. The mutual fund usually specifies\nthe minimum commitment period.\n- The mode of payment: The payment mode for an SIP can post-dated cheques, NACH,\nstanding instructions, etc.\n\n\n## Electronic payment options require an instruction to be given to the bank that is signed by all\nthe account holders. This form is part of the SIP enrolment form and registered by the mutual\nfund with the bank.\n\n\n## To start an SIP in an existing folio, the SIP enrolment form along with the post-dated cheques\nor instruction form for electronic payment has to be registered with mutual fund. If a fresh\ninvestment is being made in the scheme through the SIP, the first instalment will be used to\nopen the folio. The investor has to submit the application form duly filled along with the SIP\nenrolment form.\n\n\n## The SIP enrolment form will require the SIP commencement date, periodicity and tenor of the\nSIP, date selected, instalment amount and details of payment to be provided. The enrolment\nform along with the payment mandate has to be submitted at the official points of\nacceptance.\n\n\n## An SIP can be discontinued or cancelled by the investor giving notice of the same in writing to\nthe mutual fund and to the bank, in case of electronic payment instructions. The mutual fund\nspecifies the notice in days required before the next instalment to process the cancellation.\nDishonour of cheques and insufficient funds in the bank account of the investor are other\nways in which an SIP is discontinued.

Investors can choose to renew it on different terms with respect to investment\namount, frequency, term and payment mode.\n\n\n# 11.9.2 Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP)\n\n\n## Investors can structure a regular pay-out from the balance held in a mutual fund investment\nby registering for a systematic withdrawal plan. An SWP enables recurring redemptions from\na scheme over a period of time at the applicable NAV on the date of each redemption. It is a\nfacility that provides a defined pay-out from a fund for investors who need it. Investors\nseeking to redeem units from a scheme can also use this facility to eliminate the price risk\nassociated with redeeming all the required units at one point. In an SWP since the withdrawal\nhappens at different points, the investor will be able to benefit from the NAV volatility in the\nperiod. When the NAV is high, fewer units are redeemed to pay-out the same amount of\nmoney and vice versa.\n\n\n# Investors can register for an SWP using the transaction slip. They need to specify the following\nto the mutual fund:\n\n- Mutual fund scheme, plan & option.\n- Amount to be redeemed: The mutual fund will specify the minimum amount that can\nbe withdrawn in one instalment.\n- Frequency of withdrawal from the options provided by the mutual fund such as\nmonthly, quarterly and so on.\n- Date of redemption for each instalment has to be selected from the options provided\nby the mutual fund.\n- The period or tenor of the SWP over which the redemption will be done. The mutual\nfund may specify a minimum period for the SWP.\n- Date of commencement of the SWP. Mutual funds specify a minimum period before\nthe first redemption for the SWP request to be registered with them.\n\n\n## The SWP is redemption from a scheme. Exit loads will apply to each redemption transaction\nand there will be tax implications for the investor on redemption in the form of capital gains.\nThe redemption amount will be credited to the investor's bank account registered with the\nmutual fund. The SWP will cease automatically if the balance in the folio falls below a specified\namount. Mutual funds may offer variations to the SWP such as the facility to withdraw only\nthe appreciation in a folio in the period between one instalment and the next. Investors can\ncancel an SWP by notifying the mutual fund of the same.\n\n\n## 11.9.3 Systematic Transfer Plan (STP)\n\n\n## A systematic transfer plan combines redemption from one scheme and an investment to\nanother scheme of the same mutual fund for a defined period of time. The scheme from\n\n\n## 220\n\n\n<!-- Page 221 -->\n\n\n# which units are redeemed is called the source scheme and the scheme into which investments\nare made is called the target scheme. For example, an investor who has been accumulating\nfunds in an equity fund may decide to transfer it over a period of time to a less risky fund such\nas a short-term debt fund as the time to use the corpus comes near. Instead if the units were\nredeemed at one point, there is a risk of the NAV being low at that point in time and the\nresultant fall in the value of the corpus. The folio under which the investment in the target\nscheme will be made will be the same folio from which the redemption is done from the\nsource scheme.\n\n\n## 11.9.4 Dividend Transfer Plan (DTP)\n\n\n## The Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (Dividend) Transfer Plan (DTP) involves an\ninvestment in a particular scheme in the Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal\noption. When the fund declares a dividend, then this amount is transferred to a target fund.\nThe initial investment in the original scheme remains intact with the dividend that is mainly\nearnings from the scheme being transferred to some other scheme. This is actually similar to\nthe dividend reinvestment process, but the difference here is that the target fund where the\namount is being transferred is some other scheme and not the one where the dividend\noriginates.\n\n\n# The DTP can be used to transfer dividends from an equity scheme to a debt scheme. In this\ncase, the investor would be ensuring that the gains from the equity scheme are being invested\nin the debt scheme, thus constantly booking profit from the equity investment. On the other\nhand, dividends from a debt scheme can also be used to invest in an equity scheme. This could\nbe a way of regularly investing in an equity scheme to get the benefit of averaging of cost.\n11.9.5 Value Averaging Investment Plan\n\n\n## The normal process of systematic investment calls for a sum of money to be invested at the\nsame time after a specific time interval. This could mean a regular investment of say Rs 1,000\nevery month on the 25th of the month. Value averaging goes a step further than a normal\nsystematic investment plan and it does this by putting in more money when the market is\ndown and a lesser amount when this is high.\n\n\n## To understand this in an easy manner consider an example where there is a sum of Rs 10,000\nbeing invested each month. In a SIP this amount will remain constant over the time period of\nthe SIP. In case of value averaging there is a need to consider a growth rate for the investment.\nLet us assume this to be 1 per cent per month for simplification purposes. This means that at\nthe end of the first month the Rs. 10,000 that was invested under the value averaging\ninvestment plan would be worth Rs. 10,100.\n\n\n## If there is a comparison, then the first month has a similar amount being invested in a SIP and\nthe value averaging investment plan but the figures start diverging thereafter. In the second\n\n\n## 221",

    "page_content": "<!-- Page 222 -->\n\n\n# month the SIP amount in the example above will remain Rs. 10,000. The value averaging\ncalculation will look at the value that was supposed to be present, which is Rs. 10,100 and the\nactual value of the investment which let us assume is Rs. 9,900. There is a difference of Rs.\n200 in this calculation and to make up for this the plan will invest Rs. 10,200 in this month.\nInstead of Rs. 9,900 consider a situation where the value of the investment was Rs. 10,400. In\nthis case this is more than the value that it was supposed to be. So the second month\ninvestment in this case will turn out to be Rs. 9,700 which is Rs. 300 less because of the extra\nvalue that has been witnessed in the fund. This automatically ensures that the investment is\nmore when the prices are down and less when the prices are up.\n\n\n## There are two main challenges in this approach where the first one is the complexity of the\ncalculations. As the number of instalments increase, the calculations can get pretty\ncomplicated. The other thing is that mutual funds do not allow this kind of changes every\nmonth in a normal SIP, so the investor will have to take care of the difference in their own\nway. This can prove to be a very tough task in terms of trying to manage the investment.\nThere are products from certain AMCs that increase or decrease the quantum of SIP as per\nmarket levels. Those are easy on the investor.\n\n\n# 11.10 Investment Modes\n\n\n## Investors can directly invest in a mutual fund scheme by choosing the 'Direct Plan' option\nprovided in the application form and submitting the application to the official point of\nacceptance. All mutual fund schemes have to offer a direct plan which features a lower\nexpense ratio for investors who do not use the distribution network set up by the mutual\nfund.\n\n\n## Investors can also choose to use the services of a distributor who will assist in making the\ninvestment and provide advice and service on maintaining the investment. If investors invest\nthrough the distributor then they opt for the 'regular plan' of the scheme.\n\n\n## 11.10.1 Direct and Regular Plan\n\n\n## A normal scheme of a mutual fund with its operation is a regular plan. This is the standard\nplan that has been in operation and represents the plan which pays out distribution\ncommission to various distributors and makes various expenses in the course of its\noperations.\n\n\n## As against this a direct plan is a separate plan where the investor can invest directly with the\nfund house or its Registrar and Transfer agent. There is no distributor who helps the investor\nto make the investment in this plan. The cost of this plan is less in terms of the expense ratio,\nthat is charged to the scheme each year.\n\n\n## 222",

  {
    "page_content": "<!-- Page 223 -->\n\n\n# The portfolio of both the regular plan and the direct plan are the same. So at one level the\ninvested amount is earning the same return. The lower cost in the direct plan will however\nlead to a larger net return for the investor because a larger part of the gains remain for the\ninvestor after the various expenses are deducted.\n\n\n# The key feature that differentiates the two plans is that the regular plan has a broker or\nintermediary through whom the investor can buy the plan. There are investors who need the\nassistance of someone in making the investment. This is required especially for the\ncompletion of the process related to the investment. The regular plan is the way in which\nthese investors can use help in finishing the requirements.\n\n\n## Investors who are knowledgeable and familiar with the workings of mutual funds would want\nto consider the direct plan. They will not get the benefit of the help of the distributor but if\nthe investor is able to manage the transactions online then they can use the direct route. It\nwill translate into lower cost as the expense ratio is lower for these plans.\n\n\n## 11.10.2 Role of Investment Adviser\n\n\n## There has to be a clear understanding of the difference between the direct and the regular\nplan for the investor. The Investment adviser has to make the investor aware of this. The\nInvestment adviser has to bring out the point that looking at the cost aspect is just one angle,\nbecause this comes with its own set of conditions. In a regular plan there is an intermediary\nor a distributor who is there to help the investor in case there is a need for anything or if there\nis a problem with the investment and the process is stuck. This can happen either at the time\nof making a transaction or it can happen when there are changes in guidelines, which require\nthe investor to take some specific additional action.\n\n\n## The Investment adviser also has to clarify that the direct plan on the other hand is a 'Do it\nyourself approach' where there is no one around to help. The investor has to go and complete\nthe process by themselves and even in the future after the investment is made if there are\nsome problems then they need to tackle it themselves. They have to monitor their own\ninvestments and make the necessary decisions about any transactions in their funds.\n\n\n## The role of the investment adviser becomes critical in this entire process. The adviser has to\nsee the exact situation of the investor and then determine if they are able to handle the work\nrelated to the mutual fund investment. There are some investors who might have the\nrequired knowledge and understanding but there is also the issue of having the time and the\nspace to actually complete the different requirements related to the investment.\n\n\n# There has to be a long term look at the entire position and then a decision has to be made\nwhether the investor should be going towards the direct plan or the regular plan. In case the\ninvestment adviser is providing the investor with the necessary advice on where to invest and\nthey are using a distributor to invest in a regular plan then this would take care of the entire\n\n\n## 223",

Portfolio management\ninvolves selecting and managing a basket of assets that minimizes risk, while maximizing\nreturn on investments. A portfolio manager plays a pivotal role in designing customized\ninvestment solutions for the clients.\n\n\n## A portfolio manager is a body corporate which, pursuant to a contract or arrangement with a\nclient, advises or directs or undertakes on behalf of the client (discretionary portfolio manager\nor otherwise), the management or administration of a portfolio of securities or the client's\nfunds. Portfolio managers are registered and regulated under SEBI (Portfolio Managers)\nRegulations, 2020. According to SEBI guidelines PMS can be offered only by SEBI registered\nentities.\n\n\n## January 1993, marked the beginning of Portfolio Management Service when SEBI issued\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India (Portfolio Managers) Regulations, 1993. These were\none of the first few regulations issued by the regulators. These regulations came even before\nthe mutual fund regulations. This shows the importance of the sector to the regulator.\n\n\n## In India the major providers of portfolio management services are big brokerage firms, asset\nmanagement companies and independent experts.\n\n\n## 12.2 Types of portfolio management services\n\n\n## On the basis of provider of the services PMS can be classified as:\n\n- PMS by asset management companies\n- PMS by brokerage houses\n- Boutique (independent) PMS houses\n\n\n## They can further be classified on the basis of product class as:\n\n\n## 225",

The following are the types of portfolio management services:\n\n\n## 12.2.1 Discretionary services\n\n\n## As per SEBI's portfolio managers' regulation “discretionary portfolio manager\" means a\nportfolio manager who under a contract relating to portfolio management, exercises or may\nexercise, any degree of discretion as to the investment of funds or management of the\nportfolio of securities of the client, as the case may be. In other words, discretionary portfolio\nmanager individually and independently manages the funds of each investor as per the\ncontract. This could be based on an existing investment approach or strategy which the\nportfolio manager is offering or can be customized based on client's requirement.\n\n\n## 12.2.2 Non-discretionary services\n\n\n## Non-discretionary portfolio manager manages the funds in accordance with the directions of\nthe client. The portfolio manager does not exercise his/her discretion for the buy or sell\ndecisions. He/she has to consult the client for every transaction. Decisions like what to\nbuy/sell? And when to buy/sell? Rest with the Investor. The execution of trade is done by the\nportfolio manager. So, in this case the Portfolio manager provides investment management\nservices with the consent of the client.\n\n\n## 12.2.3 Advisory services\n\n\n## In advisory role, the portfolio manager suggests the investment ideas or provides non-binding\ninvestment advice. The investor takes the decisions. The investors also execute the\ntransactions. These kind of services are typically used for institutional clients, who manage\nportfolios on their own, but typically hire country experts in each country.\n\n\n## 12.3 Structure of PMS in India\n\n\n## A portfolio manager is a body corporate who, pursuant to a contract or arrangement with a\nclient, advises or directs or undertakes on behalf of the client (whether as a discretionary\nportfolio manager or otherwise), the management or administration of a portfolio of\nsecurities or the funds of the client.

This is usually a fixed percentage of the\namount that is actually being managed or invested into the PMS. It could be something like 1\nper cent of the amount invested. In addition, there are other costs that are related to the\ninvestment which will be charged to the investor based on the actual amount. For example,\nthe brokerage and other costs involved when the assets are bought and sold become a fixed\ncost for the investor.\n\n\n## Performance linked costs\n\n\n## The performance linked costs or the profit sharing fee are an additional amount of fees that\nthe investor has to pay to the PMS. This is present in order to incentivise the fund manager\n\n\n## 229",

If these are met then a certain percentage of the profits could be taken\nby the PMS fund manager as additional fees. These become the cost for the investor and they\nneed to be aware of how much they are actually paying at the end of the day because the\nperformance linked costs can turn out to be quite high.\n\n\n## High watermark principle\n\n\n## The PMS usually collects a percentage of the assets as a fee so the calculation for this purpose\nbecomes important. High watermark is usually the corpus investment value or the NAV at\nwhich fees have been paid historically. The PMS should not be collecting fees for some recent\npoor performance and this is where the high watermark principle comes in. According to this\nprinciple once the fees are calculated on a specific level of assets then the next payment\nwould only come about when the previous higher level is passed. For example, if there are\nprofit sharing fees are to be calculated on the gains of the corpus invested at Rs 50 lakh and\nif in one year this rises to Rs 60 lakh then Rs 10 lakh would be the basis for the calculation.\nNext year if the portfolio value drops to Rs 55 lakh then till it crosses the previous high of Rs\n60 lakh the profit sharing fee would not be calculated. Returns are computed per financial\nyear. Provided returns are higher than hurdle rate, profit sharing will be there, as per terms,\nsubject to the condition that the current fund value is higher than the previous high water\nmark.\n\n\n## Hurdle rate\n\n\n## This is the rate which would need to be crossed if the PMS would charge extra fees to the\ninvestor. This is mentioned in the PMS agreement. For example, it could be that the hurdle\nrate is 8 per cent. In this case till the return is 8 per cent there is no profit-sharing fee\ncalculation and then only when this rate is crossed would the calculation start.\n\n\n## Catch-up/no catch-up concept\n\n\n## This is used by the PMS for the purpose of calculation of the fees. There is a hurdle rate that\nis usually present which is the rate till which no extra fees would be charged. Once this rate\nis crossed the question arises as to whether the full gains or only the gains above the hurdle\nrate would be used for the calculation. The no catch-up concept is that only the incremental\namount above the hurdle rate would be considered while the catch up concept would then\nlook at the fees right from the first earning which would need to catch up to the total earnings.\n\n\n## 230\n\n\n<!-- Page 231 -->\n\n\n# 12.7 Direct access facility offered by PMS\n\n\n# Difference with regular plan\n\n\n# The direct plan way of investing is popular with mutual fund investors. In a direct plan the\ninvestor does not use the services of an intermediary like a broker or a distributor but goes\ndirectly to the service provider. This cuts out the need for commission for the intermediary\nand there is a separate value for such plans because the cost for these will be lower. All this\ngoes on to increase the net returns for the investor.\n\n\n## There is now a provision for direct access facility in PMS too whereby there are no distributors\nwho are involved in the selling of the plan. This will have a situation where the investor goes\nand directly puts money into the PMS without any intermediary. The direct access facility has\nthe same benefit in the PMS as in a mutual fund which is that the cost for this will be lower.\nThe lower amount of expenses will lead to a lower amount being charged as expenses to the\ninvestor.\n\n\n## The PMS has to offer this direct access facility so that any investor who wants to skip the\nintermediaries can directly approach the PMS provider and then put their money. The rest of\nthe process of the management of the funds does not differ and hence this is a route that the\ninvestors can adopt. The regular plan of the PMS will operate in the traditional way with its\nnormal expenses including that paid to the distributors.\n\n\n## Role of Investment Advisers\n\n\n## The role of Investment Advisers in empowering the investor is pretty significant. They are the\nones who are guiding the investors in various steps that are in their interest and which also\nhelps them to save cost while getting the best services at the same time.\n\n\n## When it comes to the PMS the investment adviser has to consider the position of the client.\nThe need for the client to get into a PMS as compared to various other instruments has to be\nchecked. Once it is clear that the investor needs to have a PMS then the suitability of the\ndirect access plan has to be considered.\n\n\n## There is often no need to go through an intermediary especially when the client is aware\nabout the nature of the investment and what it involves. When it comes to advising on the\nexposure to a PMS the investment adviser can ask their clients to take the direct access facility\nas it will enable them to save on costs. The other factor related to the PMS do not change and\nhence this is not going to have any impact as far as performance is concerned. In addition,\ndepending on the client's situation the Investment Adviser has to guide them as to whether\nthey should go in for a discretionary plan or a non-discretionary one or even the advisory\nservice. This could result in a higher net return for the investor which will be a beneficial thing\nfor them.\n\n\n## 231",

Alternative investments are\ntherefore defined generally by several sources as investments other than traditional\ninvestments. Traditional investments¹² (as distinguished from savings in bank deposits,\ngovernment schemes, ornamental gold and residential property for living purposes) are\nconfined to the domain of financial securities such as stocks and bonds from primary and\nsecondary capital market, purchase of general categories of mutual fund units and Exchange\nTraded Funds (ETFs). Traditional investments cater to general investors who seek investment\noptions which provide better returns than mere savings schemes.\n\n\n## Alternative investments have evolved over time to cater to the requirements of sophisticated\ninvestors such as institutional investors managing pools of funds and High net-worth\nindividual investors (HNIs) who have higher risk-taking capability and need more\nsophisticated avenues than traditional investment options. Unlike traditional investments,\nalternative investments are about investing in opportunities that can potentially generate\nhigher returns but entail higher risk-taking as well. Alternative investments are meant to\ncomplement traditional investments for such investors by improving their risk-adjusted\nreturns over the long term.\n\n\n# Traditional investments are primarily on-market opportunities whose common feature is\nliquidity, i.e. nearness to cash because they can be exited through the market or by anytime\nredemption offered by an open ended mutual fund. The essential characteristic of alternative\n\n\n## 12 According to Investopedia, “An alternative investment is a financial asset that does not fall into one of the conventional\ninvestment categories. Conventional categories include stocks, bonds, and cash.\"\n\n\n## 233",

All these investors have large\npools of funds managed by fund managers who would be seeking varied investment options\nbeyond traditional investments. AIFs cater to the needs of such investors through alternative\nasset classes.\n\n\n## 13.2 Evolution and Growth of AIFs in India\n\n\n## The evolution of alternative investments in India began with venture capital financing in the\n1980s, driven by state-level industrial development corporations, financial institutions, and\nPSU banks. The late emergence of venture capital was tied to market conditions and\nownership patterns.\n\n\n## SEBI broadened the scope of venture capital in 1996 with the SEBI (Venture Capital Fund)\nRegulations, removing the focus on 'untried technologies' and bringing private capital\ninvestment in unlisted companies under institutional investment. However, tax laws were\ninitially unfavorable until reforms in 2000, following the K.B. Chandrasekhar Committee's\nrecommendations. The dotcom boom (1997-2001) saw the rise of tech-focused VCFs\nmodeled after Silicon Valley.\n\n\n## Post-2001, private equity expanded beyond IT, reaching manufacturing, real estate,\ninfrastructure, and services. By 2007, sectoral biases faded, and private equity extended into\nbanking, logistics, e-commerce, and even project financing.\n\n\n# The 2008 financial crisis disrupted private equity growth, with funds struggling to sustain\ninvestments and exit due to weak capital markets. In the aftermath, private equity in India\nfaced challenges from macroeconomic issues and concerns over regressive taxation laws\n\n\n## 13.3 SEBI requirements on AIF\n\n\n## Definition of AIF\n\n\n# The SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations 2012 (AIF Regulations) that currently\nregulate such activity define the term 'Alternative Investment Fund' (AIF) as one which is\nprimarily a privately pooled investment vehicle. However, since there are several types of\ninvestment funds in the market, the definition prescribes that only a 'privately pooled\nstructure with funds pooled from India or abroad for a defined investment policy is to be\nconsidered as an AIF. The words 'privately pooled' denote that the fund is pooled from select\ninvestors and not from the general public at large. There is a limit of 1000 investors through\nprivate placement. These private investors are sourced from categories such as institutions\n\n\n## 234",

Other funds that are considered\neconomically beneficial and are provided special incentives by the government or any\nregulator are also considered as part of this Category.\n\n\n## Category II AIF - is an AIF that does not fall in Category I and III and which does not undertake\nleverage or borrowing other than to meet day-to-day operational requirements or as\npermitted in the Regulations. For this purpose, AIFs such as private equity funds or debt funds\nfor which no specific incentives or concessions are given by the government or any other\nRegulator are included under this Category.\n\n\n## Category III AIF – is an AIF that which employs diverse or complex trading strategies and may\nemploy leverage including through investment in listed or unlisted derivatives.

Many types of debt that\nare private are considered to be alternative investments because of their illiquidity and often\nbecause they are not commonly held by traditional investors. Even listed companies issue\ndebt securities such as non-convertible debentures (NCDs) and bonds through private\nplacement that are not available in the traditional investment route. Some of the venture\nfinancing funds also term themselves as 'venture debt funds' since they finance advanced\nstage of venture capital through mezzanine financing (debt financing with some equity upside\nlike warrants attached to them.). Some private debt funds also finance sub-ordinate debt\nwhich can go in funding companies that are already having high senior debt (loans that are\nsecured on the assets and have first claim on cash flow) on their balance sheet, such debt\nfinancing is called 'leveraged loan'.\n\n13 Equity linked instruments include instruments convertible into equity shares or share warrants, preference shares,\ndebentures compulsorily or optionally convertible into equity.\n\n\n## 238",

In other\nwords, this adage is addressing the benefits of diversification. Diversification is nothing but\nspreading out the investments across different areas or asset classes to reduce risk as every\nasset will not behave similarly at all times. Prior to 1950, investing community was familiar\nwith the benefits of holding a diversified portfolio. However, they had no way of quantifying\nthe benefits of diversification.\n\n\n## In 1952 The Journal of Finance published an article titled “Portfolio Selection\", authored by\nHarry Markowitz. Decades later in 1990, Harry Markowitz was honoured with the Nobel Prize\nin Economics for his portfolio theory. The ideas introduced in this article have come to form\nthe foundations of what is now popularly referred as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). In\nsimple words, MPT provides a framework for constructing and selecting portfolios based on\nthe expected performance of the investments and the risk appetite of the investor. MPT\nquantified the concept of diversification by introducing the statistical notion of covariance, or\ncorrelation between investment assets. Harry Markowitz mathematically demonstrated that\nthe variance of the rate of return is a meaningful measure of portfolio risk. He derived the\nformula for computing the variance of a portfolio, showing how to effectively diversify a\nportfolio.\n\n\n## 14.2 Assumptions of the theory\n\nSome of the assumptions of the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) are as under\n\n\n# An investor wants to maximize the return for a given level of risk. That means given a\nchoice between two assets with equal rate of return, investors will select the asset\nwith lower risk. Investors consider each investment alternative as being presented by\n\n\n## 243",

Investors choose an action or event\nwith the maximum expected utility. Investors assign utility scores to the various\nportfolio choices available to them.\n\n\n# Utility curves demonstrate diminishing marginal utility of wealth. Though investors\nhave different rates of decrease in the marginal utility of wealth, the principle is that\nper rupee increment to utility decreases with wealth.\n\n\n## Investors estimate the risk of the portfolio on the basis of the variability of expected\nreturns of constituent assets.\n\n\n## Investors base decisions solely on expected return and risk, so their utility curves are\na function of expected return and the expected variance (or standard deviation) of\nreturns only.\n\n14.3 Definition of risk averse, risk seeking and risk neutral investor\n\n\n## The presence of risk means more than one outcome is possible. Investors demand risk\npremium for bearing the risk. The question whether a given risk premium is adequate is a\ncentral theme in investment management. Measurement of risk and determination of risk\npremium is an important area of work in finance.\n\n\n## A prospect that has a zero risk premium is called a fair game. Risk averse investors reject fair\ngame. Risk averse investors will invest in risk-free investment opportunities or in investment\nopportunities with positive expected risk premium. The greater the risk, greater the demand\nfor risk premium. Investors assign utility score to competing portfolios given their expected\nreturn and risk involved. Higher utility scores are assigned to those portfolios with better risk-\nreturn profile. Higher utility scores are assigned to portfolios with higher expected return and\nlower utility scores are assigned to portfolios with higher risk.\n\n\n## Investors are assumed to be comparing the utility value of the risky portfolio with risk free\ninvestment offering the same utility to determine Certainty Equivalent Rate (CER). Certainty\nequivalent rate is the rate that a risk-free investment has to offer to be equally attractive with\nrisky investment. A highly risk averse investor may assign a risky portfolio with a CER below\nthe risk-free rate of return and reject investments into risky portfolio. A less risk averse\ninvestors may assign a higher CER and accept the same risky portfolio.\n\n\n## A risk neutral investor on the other hand evaluates the investment opportunities solely on\nthe basis of expected return with no regard to risk. The amount of risk is irrelevant to the risk\nneutral person. Risk neutral person provide no penalty for risk. For risk neutral investor,\nportfolio CER is expected rate of return on the risky portfolio.\n\n\n## 244",

Calculation of expected rate of return for individual security\n\n\n## Expected rate of return of an individual investment opportunity is the sum of the potential\nreturns multiplied with the corresponding probability of the returns.\n\n\n## Suppose the following returns are forecasted for stocks A and B in three possible scenarios:\n\n\n## State\n\n\n## Probability\n\n\n## B\n\n\n## |\n\n\n## Boom\n\n\n## 0.3\n\n\n## 15%\n\n\n## 25%\n\n\n## ||\n\n\n## Normal\n\n\n## 0.5\n\n\n## 10%\n\n\n## 20%\n\n\n## |||\n\n\n## Recession\n\n\n## 0.2\n\n\n## 2%\n\n\n## 1%\n\n\n## The expected return of these two stocks will be calculated as follow:\n\n\n## R_{A}=.3(15\\%)+.5(10\\%)+.2(2\\%)=9.9\\%\n\n\n## R_{B}=.3(25\\%)+.5(20\\%)+.2(1\\%)=17.7\\%\n\nWhere RA: Expected return of Stock A and R_{B} is expected return of stock B\n\n\n## Calculation of Variance of return for individual security\n\n\n## Risk for an asset is defined as variability in return. One of the best-known measures of risk is\nstandard deviation of expected returns (square root of variance of expected returns). It is a\nstatistical measure of the dispersion of returns around the expected value. Larger variance\n(larger standard deviation) indicates greater dispersion, hence larger risk.\n\n\n## Variance is a measure of the variation of possible rates of return, from the expected rate of\nreturn. Standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n\n\n## The calculation of Variance of an individual investment is shown in table below:\n\n- List down the yearly returns (Investment returns – X)\n- Compute the mean of the returns (Average Return - X)\n- Subtract each year's return from the mean (X-\\overline{X})\n- Square each year's deviation, which is variance\n\n\n## (X-\\overline{X})^{2}\n\n- Add all the values\n\n\n## 245",

Importance of Asset Allocation Decision\n\n\n## Asset allocation is the process of deciding how to distribute an investor's wealth into different\nasset classes for investment purposes. An asset class is defined as a collection of securities\nthat have similar characteristics, attributes, and risk/return relationships. Examples of various\nasset, are bonds, equities, cash and cash like securities etc., A broad asset class, such as\n\"bonds,\" can be divided into sub-asset classes, like Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, and junk\nbonds. Equity can further be divided into large cap, mid cap & small cap.\n\n\n## Asset allocation decision is a very important investment decision. This is the starting point for\nthe investor as they set out to achieve their goals. Professional Investment experience has\nbeen suggesting that in the long run asset-allocation decision majorly influences the\nperformance of investment portfolios. The asset allocation decision is not an isolated\ndecision, it is a component of the overall portfolio management process. Choice of individual\nproducts within an asset class is relevant, but contributes less than the overall allocation, to\nthe end-result.\n\n\n## 251",

A value of +1 (-1) indicates a perfect\npositive (negative) relationship between the two variables. A positive relationship between\ntwo variables means that they both move together in the same direction, either in an upward\ntrend or downward trend. Negative relationship means the opposite. The value of the\ncorrelation coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship between the two variables.\nUnderstanding correlation across asset classes is very crucial in making asset allocation\ndecision. Investments that are part of same asset class are sensitive to the same major\neconomic and/or investment factors. Hence the correlation between assets that are part of\nthe same asset class is expected to be high where correlation two different asset classes is\nexpected to be low.\n\n\n## Correlation is the most relevant factor in reaping the benefits of risk diversification i.e. in\nreducing portfolio risk. Correlations among asset class returns can and do change over time\nand also in different economic situations. Asset return correlation in future may also differ\nfrom those observed in the past because of changing economic and market regimes.\n\n\n## Investors should take these factors into consideration while making asset allocation decisions\nand should not solely depend on past correlation metrics¹6.\n\n\n## 15.3 Steps in Portfolio Construction Process\n\n\n# Portfolio management process involves a set of integrated activities undertaken in a logical,\norderly and consistent manner to create and maintain an optimum portfolio. The elements in\nthe portfolio management process are planning, execution and evaluation as discussed\nbelow:\n\n- The first step in the process of portfolio management is development of policy\nstatement for the portfolio. It is a road map that identifies investor's risk appetite and\ndefines investment objectives, goals and investment constraints.\n- The second step involves study of current financial conditions and forecast of future\ntrends.\n- The third step is construction of the portfolio after taking into consideration policy\nstatement and investor's objectives, risk appetite and horizon. Investor needs and\nfinancial market forecasts being dynamic, portfolio requires continuous monitoring\nand rebalancing.\n- The fourth step in portfolio management process is performance measurement &\nevaluation.\n\n\n## 16 Financial services data integrators like Bloomberg, Capital IQ etc., provide information on Correlation co efficient\nbetween various assets and securities.

IPS is the road map that guides the investment process. Either\ninvestors or their Investment advisers draft the IPS specifying their investment objectives,\ngoals, constraints, preferences and risks they are willing to take. All investment decision are\nbased on IPS considering investors' goals and objectives, risk appetite etc., Since Investors\nrequirements change over a period time, IPS also needs to be updated and revised\nperiodically. IPS forms the basis for strategic asset allocation which is essentially an\ninteraction between investors risk-return requirements and expected investments' return.\n15.3.2. Need and importance for IPS\n\n\n## IPS is an important planning tool which help investors understand their requirements and also\nhelp portfolio managers in creating and maintaining optimum portfolios for the investors.\nPreparation of IPS inculcates a disciplined system and process in managing investments. It\nreduces the possibility of making inappropriate decisions.\n\n\n# There are four important purposes the policy statement serves:\n\n- It enables investors to have realistic return expectation from their investments\n- It enables portfolio manager to make effective investment decisions in line with the\nobjectives of the investor.\n- It provides a framework for portfolio managers evaluation with respect to the\ninvestments.\n- It protects the investor against portfolio manager's inappropriate investment\ndecisions or unethical behaviour.\n\n\n## In summary, a well-defined policy portfolio goes a long way in serving the investor's interest.\nIt enables construction of an optimal investment portfolio.\n\n\n## 15.3.3.

There\nshould be a clear mention of the risk/return profile of the investor along with the liquidity\nconstraints plus naming preferred asset classes even those asset classes that need to be\navoided can be mentioned. There has to a systematic review process present in the IPS which\nwill allow the investor to remain on track to achieve their goals.\n\n\n# 15.4 Investment Objectives\n\n\n## Investors' objectives are identified in relation to risk-return-liquidity. Investors may state their\ninvestment objectives in terms of desired return in absolute or relative sense. They need to\nbear in mind that risk and return have typically positive relationship. Higher the risk, higher\nthe return. On the other hand, liquidity has inverse relationship with return. Relatively illiquid\ninvestments require premium for being less liquid, i.e. illiquidity risk premium.\nGenerally, investors invest for preservation of capital, regular Income and capital\nappreciation. The investment objectives lead to an asset allocation decision. If the investment\nobjective is capital appreciation, then investments need to be in high return investments (like\nequity). Of course, these investments will have higher risk than government securities or bank\nfixed deposits. On the other hand, if capital preservation is the primary investment objective,\nasset allocation will be tilted towards safe bonds and debt securities. If regular income is the\ninvestment objective, funds will be invested in asset classes generating periodical income like\ndividend paying stocks, interest paying bond or/and rent paying realty.\n\n\n# 15.5 Investment Constraints\n\n\n## Constraints are limitations on investors to take exposure to certain investment opportunities.\nConstraints relates to investors liquidity needs, time horizon, and other unique needs and\npreferences.\n\n\n## 15.5.1. Liquidity constraint\n\n\n## Different investors have different liquidity requirements. Younger people usually have lesser\nliquidity requirements than older people. Some may have some health or medical concerns\nwhich require them to maintain certain liquid funds. Others may have requirements of college\nfees or wedding in the family or some other needs. Generally, investors prefer to have liquid\nfunds to meet their day-to-day expenses. Additionally, they may like to keep some amount of\nliquidity to meet contingency requirements like sudden medical expenses etc.\n\n\n# The needs for liquidity fall into three categories:\n\n- Emergency Cash. The emergency cash reserve is usually measured at two to three\nmonths' spending, but it could be more if the individual's source of income is at risk or volatile.\n\n\n## 254",

For known goals due within a\nyear, the amount needed to achieve these goals should be in assets with relatively good\nliquidity and less risk.\n- Investment Flexibility. The ability to take advantage of market opportunities as asset\nclasses become overvalued and undervalued would require greater degree of liquidity.\n\n\n## To meet the such requirements, some portion of the portfolio should be in cash or cash like\nsecurities. The Investment adviser or the manager need to make detailed assessment of the\nliquidity needs of the investors. As keeping too much money for liquidity may hit the overall\nportfolio return. On the other hand, not maintaining sufficient liquidity will lead to\ninconvenience and selling of other investments untimely. The liquidity constraints of the\ninvestor need to be clearly specified in the IPS.\n\n\n## 15.5.2. Regulatory constraints\n\n\n## Generally individual investors do not have many regulatory constraints. But if there are any,\nthey need to be followed. Regulations can also constraint the investment choices available to\nthe investors. For example, as per the Reserve Bank of India's¹7 notification, Liberalised\nRemittance Scheme (LRS), an Indian resident individual can only invest up to\n$250,000 overseas per year. Indian resident individual Investors cannot make investments\ngreater than the amount specified by the regulator. Another example is the sell or purchase\nof securities on the basis of information that is not publicly known. Usually, people who have\naccess to such information are insiders of the company and they are prohibited from trading\non the basis of insider information.\n\n\n# 15.5.3. Tax Constraint\n\n\n## Investment process is complicated by tax concerns. Tax plays a very important role in portfolio\nmanagement and drives investment decisions. Different investments and different kinds of\nincome are taxed differently. Return in form of income like interest, dividend and rents versus\nreturn in form of capital appreciation are taxed differently.

An investment approach is a broad outlay\nof the type of securities and permissible instruments to be invested in by the portfolio\nmanager for the investor, taking into account factors specific to investor and securities. It\nshould also include the type of instruments and proportion of exposure.\n\n\n## After taking into account the investor's objective, risk appetite, liquidity needs, tax and other\nregulatory constraints, time horizon for investment, exposure limits to specific sectors,\nentities and asset classes can be set to avoid \"concentration risk”. The portfolio manager\nneeds to adhere to these exposure limits while managing investments.\n\n\n## 15.7 Unique needs and preferences\n\n\n## Sometimes investors have idiosyncratic concerns. They may have personal, social ethical,\ncultural and preferences beliefs. For example, an investor may not want her money to be\ninvested in the stocks of companies selling environmentally harmful products. Another\nexample could be of an investor owning stocks of the company she is working with, reluctant\nto sell the same even when it is financial prudent, due to emotional attachment. The point is\neach investor is unique and if she has any specific preference, the same should be clearly\nspecified in the IPS.\n\n\n## In addition to the above-mentioned section, the IPS may also include reporting requirements,\nportfolio rebalancing schedules, frequency of performance communication, investment\nstrategy and styles etc.\n\n\n## 15.7.1 Learn about sustainable investing\n\n\n## Sustainable investing is a growing field across the world which considers environmental, social\nand governance (ESG) criteria while selecting investments. The goal is to generate financial\nreturns while at the same time ensure positive impact on society. There are several reasons\nfor undertaking sustainable investing which could be personal values or needs of the investor\nor even mission of an institution. The idea is to improve on the environmental, social and\ngovernance practices and such investments are determined after comparison on these\nspecific criteria. The investments are also checked to see if they are future ready to tackle the\nemerging challenges facing the world and there is also a growing belief that focusing on these\nfactors leads to financial outperformance too. Some factors considered under governance are\nBoard independence, Board diversity and Executive compensation. Under social factors are\nWorkplace safety, Community development and Human rights while environmental factors\nwould include areas like Pollution, Water use and Clean technology adopted.\n\n\n## 256",

A key factor in\nthe entire process that this depends a lot on the investor's views. Often ethical investing is\nused interchangeably with sustainable or socially conscious investing but there is a key\ndifference between the two. The latter is based on an overall set of guidelines that screen out\nthe investments but ethical investing is more personalised. So ethical investing would typically\navoid sin areas like gambling, alcohol, smoking or even firearms.\n\n\n## 15.8 Assessments of needs and requirements of investor\n\n\n# Investors invest to meet their various goals and objectives. Assessment of the needs and\nrequirements of the investors is critical in making investment decisions. People have many\nfinancial goals, some are to be achieved in near term, some are medium or long term goals.\nThe goals also have different priority – some are high priority goals where as others may not\nbe very important to achieve. Investors can put their needs and goals down along with the\npriority and the time frame for each of those goals, with the funds needed for the same. A\nproforma for creating a goal sheet is given below:\n\n\n## No. Goal\n\n\n## Priority\n\n\n## High\n\n\n## Low\n\n\n## Moderate\n\n\n## Time period\n\n\n## Amount needed\n\n\n## Near-Term High Priority Goals have a high emotional priority which the investor wishes to\nachieve within just a few years at most. As a result, investment vehicles for these goals tend\nto be either cash equivalents or fixed-income instruments with maturity dates that match the\ngoal date. For people of limited to modest means, the cost of not achieving those goals is just\ntoo great to take a risk with more-volatile approaches.\n\n\n## For many investors building a retirement corpus is a long-term high priority goal. When\ninvestors start planning for this goal well in advance, they have enough time to accumulate\nthe corpus. Because of the long-term nature of such goals, a diversified approach utilizing\nseveral different classes of assets is usually preferred.\n\n\n## People also have many low priority goals. There are goals that are not particularly painful if\nthey are not achieved. These could range from buying a farm house to a luxury car. For these\ngoals more-aggressive investment approaches are usually taken.\n\n\n## 257",

This helps in organizing financial data in a systematic way. Personal financial\nstatements include a statement of net worth-balance sheet and income-expense statements.\nFor calculating net worth, all the assets the investor owns, i.e. the house, the car,\nthe\ninvestments in stocks, bonds & mutual fund, balance in the saving accounts, value of the\njewels owned and the value of all other financial assets and real assets are to be recorded at\nthe estimated market value. Then all the liabilities need to be subtracted from the assets.\nLiabilities may include the outstanding car loan amount, credit card loans, home loan and any\nother amount he owes like the personal loan, education loan etc. The difference between the\nvalue of assets and the liability is net worth. It is suggested that net worth is to be calculated\nperiodically, at least once in a year. The next step is calculating whether the person's present\nincome exceeds spending and by how much amount. This is the amount which would be\navailable periodically for investment purposes. The income expenditure statement can be\nprepared on monthly basis.\n\n\n## 15.10 Psychographic analysis of investor\n\n\n## In the investment process, investor's behavioural traits and personality characteristics also\nplay an important role in setting their risk profile. Psychographic analysis of investor bridges\nthe gap between standard finance which treats investors as rational human beings and\nbehavioural finance which view them as normal human beings who have biases and make\ncognitive errors. In other words, psychographic analysis of investor recognizes investors as\nnormal human beings who are susceptible to biased or irrational behaviour.\n\n\n## All investors have unique personalities. And though it is difficult to categorize the\npersonalities because they all are human beings and they are so different; some basic\nclassification system has evolved after years of research. There are many frameworks\navailable to perform psychographic analysis. For illustration purpose, given below is the\nframework given by Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser (BB&K).\n\n\n# Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser (BB&K) classifies investor personalities by focusing on two aspects: the\nlevel of confidence and the method of action. The first deals with how the investor\napproaches life in terms of career, wealth or money. The second element deals with whether\nthe investor is careful, methodical and analytical in the approach towards life. The two\nelements can be thought of as two \"axis\" of individual psychology: one axis is the\nconfidence/anxiousness the other is carefulness/ impetuousness\n\n\n## The different personality characteristics are shown through Exhibit 15.1.\n\n\n## 258",

As far as they are concerned,\nit is a carefully considered decision. They are confident as well as impetuous. In that quadrant,\none typically will find entrepreneurial people, people who are willing to stick their necks out\nin their careers or in their money management strategies. They normally have their own ideas\nabout investing. They are willing to take risks, and they normally do not go for the investment\nadvisers. They prefer concentrating their bets.\n\n\n# The lower-right quadrant of Figure is the Celebrity quadrant. These people like to be where\nthe action is. They are afraid of being left out. These investors will keep bringing up the latest\nhot topic, asking, \"Should I be in this, or should I be in that?\" They really do not have their\nown ideas about investments. These people normally go for investment advisers. However,\nthey are the most difficult investors to deal with because of their own confused beliefs.\nThe individual list is in the upper-left quadrant. These people have certain degree of\nconfidence about them, but they are also careful, methodical, and analytical. Individualists\nlike to do their own research and tend to avoid extreme volatility. They are often contrarian\ninvestors because they do sit back and think about where they want to go and which\ninvestments make good value sense\n\n\n## The lower-left quadrant represents the Guardian personality. Typically, as people get older\nand begin considering retirement, they approach this personality profile. Guardians are\npeople who are cautiously trying to preserve their wealth. They are definitely not interested\nin volatility or excitement.\n\n\n## Finally, there are always people who are so well balanced that they cannot be placed in any\nspecific quadrant, so they fall near the centre; this investor is called a straight-arrow investors.\nOn average, this group of investors is a relatively balanced composite of each of the other\nfour investor types, and by implication a group willing to be exposed to medium risk.\n\n\n## 259",

This can be particularly influenced by his most recent investment\nexperience. A guardian can become more aggressive for a time, like an adventurer, if he is on\na winning streak. Conversely, most investors become more guardian like just after an event\nwith heightened volatility.\n\n\n## Experience has shown that each of the five types of investors requires a different approach in\nportfolio management.\n\n\n## 15.11 Life cycle analysis of investor\n\n\n## It is important to understand the various stages in the life cycle; because of the impact they\nhave on an investor's risk appetite.\n\n\n## Return\n\n\n# Higher Return\nHigher Risk\n\n\n## Lower Return\n\n\n## Risk\n\n\n## Lower Risk\n\n\n# Every investor has thoughts about where she might be along that line, especially when the\npoints are described in terms of risk and returns. Generally younger individuals who are just\nbeginning to earn money tend to be on the right side of the line, while older individuals move\nincreasingly to the left side on the line. This life cycle of investing can be broken into phases:\nthe accumulation, consolidation, spending, and gifting phases. This is depicted in Exhibit 15.2.\nExhibit 15.2: Lifecycle of investing\n\n\n## Net Worth\n\n\n## 260\n\n\n## Accumulation Phase\n\n\n## Consolidation Phase\n\n\n## Spending Phase\n\n\n## Gifting\n\n\n## Phase\n\n\n# Vertical (Value) Axis Major Gridlines\n\n\n## 25\n\n\n## 35\n\n\n## 45\n\n\n## 55\n\n\n## 65\n\n\n## Age\n\n\n## 75\n\n\n<!-- Page 261 -->\n\n\n# Accumulation Phase: In the accumulation or early career phase. During this phase net worth\nis typically small relative to liabilities. Investments are fewer and typically non-diversified.\nGoals may include children's educations, a house, and if possible, investments for future\nfinancial independence. But because the individual has a very long time horizon and a\npotentially growing stream income, she can undertake more high-return, high-risk capital\ngain-oriented investments.\n\n\n## Consolidation Phase: The consolidation or mid-to-late-career stage of the typical life cycle is\ncharacterized by the period when income exceeds expenses. As a result, this stage is\ncharacterized by the consolidation of investment portfolio. At this time, while the time\nhorizon to retirement is still relatively long (15 or 20 years), investors may start looking for\ncapital preservation. High capital gain investments are balanced with some lower-risk assets.\nDecumulation/Spending Phase: The \"decumulation/spending phase\" is defined as the period\nwhen living expenses are covered not from earned income but from accumulated assets such\nas investments and retirement corpus. Because of the heavy reliance on investments in this\nphase and the unlikelihood of going back to work, the focus is on stability in investment\nportfolio. Preference will be on investment that generate dividend, interest, and rental\nincome. As the investor's time horizon may still be well over 15 or 20 years, some investments\nin the portfolio should continue to have growth and inflation-hedge potential.\n\n\n## Gifting Phase: This is the final phase when a person realizes that she has more assets than she\nwill need for spending. In such cases the attitude about the purpose of investments does\nchange. Investments at this stage may be made to leave legacy, support a charitable cause\netc.\n\nIt is important to note that the boundaries between the stages are fuzzy on time scale.\n\n\n## 15.12 Forecasting risk and return of various asset classes\n\n\n## Portfolio Management is the process of integrating two sets of information. The first set of\nrequired inputs have already been listed above viz., investment objectives, goals and\nrequirements, personality type, phase in the life cycle, liquidity needs, tax and other\nconstraints etc., The second set of required inputs is the capital market forecasts that\nestablishes the expected risk-return opportunities available to the investors.\n\n\n## The various investment opportunities available to the investors need to be listed and their\nreturns need to be forecasted along with the possibilities of deviations in those returns.\nHistorical risk-return on various asset classes provide a good starting point to understand the\nrelationship between risk and return and proceed to make the forecast about their future\nreturn possibilities.\n\n\n## 261",

It will typically include a benchmark portfolio which matches in\ncomposition of the investor's portfolio. The idea is to compare \"apple with apple”. If the\ninvestment is made in large cap equities, BSE 30 or NIFTY 50 can be an appropriate\nbenchmark. If the investment is made in long term bonds, a bond index with similar maturity\nand credit profile will be an appropriate benchmark.\n\n\n## 15.13.1 Selection of benchmarks\n\n\n## The selection of benchmarks is a crucial point in evaluating the performance for the investor.\nA wrong selection can paint a completely different picture which could lead to wrong\ninvestment decisions. For example, a large cap portfolio has to be compared to a large cap\nindex and similarly a mid-cap portfolio with a mid-cap index. A debt portfolio too needs the\nright kind of benchmark that represents the nature of the investments made.\n\n\n## Sometimes there is a need to ensure that there are multiple or hybrid benchmarks used for\nthe purpose of comparison. This can be done by either comparing the relevant part of the\nportfolio to a separate benchmark or if there is a stable asset allocation mix or stable mix\nwithin an asset class then even hybrid benchmarks are available which would be more\nrepresentative of the entire situation.\n\n\n## A benchmark once selected should also be reviewed on a regular basis. If the nature of the\ninvestment changes or the benchmark composition changes then there might be a need to\nchange the benchmark too.\n\n\n## 15.14 Asset allocation decision\n\n\n## The interaction between the two sets of information - about the investor and about the risk-\nreturn on investment opportunity culminates into asset allocation decision. The asset\nallocation decision follows logically from the investor's needs and goals, risk preferences and\nliquidity needs. After developing a forecast on risk and return on various asset classes, the\nportfolio manager has to decide the mix of assets that optimises the after-tax returns for the\ninvestor.\n\n\n# 15.15 Portfolio Construction Principles\n\n\n## The portfolio construction process follows from the requirements of the investors along with\ntheir goals and the time period in which these have to be achieved. The Investment Adviser\ncan help the client to construct their portfolio keeping several principles in mind.\n\n\n## 15.15.1 Selecting Equity portfolios\n\n\n## Equity portfolios should represent the right mix of risk and stability that is required by the\ninvestor.

The right mix should be\nfollowed by the investor based on their risk taking ability. Higher dividend yield stocks can\nalso generate a cash flow from equities, but capital appreciation provides the bulk of returns\nfrom equities. The extent of equity exposure will depend on the goals of the investor and the\ntime period available to achieve those goals.\n\n\n# 15.15.2 Selecting Debt portfolios\n\n\n## While selecting a debt portfolio there has to be a look at the investment horizon and match\nthe maturity of the investment with the horizon. This will require the choice of a specific kind\nof instruments. At the same time short term debt instruments are to be used for the purpose\nof meeting short term goals. Even parking money for a few days can lead to some higher\nreturns rather than these lying in the bank account. The ability of the investor to take credit\nrisk will also determine the type of instruments that are included in the medium to long term\ndebt portfolio.\n\n\n## 15.15.3 Selecting Hybrid portfolios\n\n\n## Hybrid portfolios ensure that there is an element of stability to the investments and at the\nsame time there is a potential upside in case the performance of various assets turns out to\nbe better. Hybrid portfolios are meant to achieve a specific objective and are used as a long-\nterm goal starts getting near. Sometimes instead of selecting the debt and equity mix\nseparately there might be use of hybrid investments to achieve the same objective. The shift\nto such portfolios can ensure a smooth transition for the investor in terms of their asset\nallocation mix.\n\n\n## 15.15.4 Other portfolios\n\n\n## Other portfolios will have added elements in them which could include assets like gold or\nother precious metals and even alternative investments. These portfolios are looking to raise\nthe overall return but at the same time provide a different kind exposure leading to\ndiversification. This can be helpful for the investor in reducing their risk and maintaining\nstability.\n\n\n## 15.16 Strategic versus Tactical Asset Allocation\n\n\n## The asset allocation decision which is made after taking into consideration investor's\ncharacteristics is strategic asset allocation (SAA). It is the target policy portfolio. It provides\ntarget allocation among the major asset classes; in that sense it is essentially translation of an\ninvestment policy statement into asset weights. SAA is the long-term asset allocation\ndecision. SAA is designed to meet the investors goals and objective over a longer period of\ntime.\n\n\n## There is, however, a dynamic component to asset allocation - tactical asset allocation (TAA).\nTactical asset allocation TAA is short-term asset allocation decision. These decisions are taken\n\n\n## 263",

When market conditions favour one asset class over\nother, the portfolio manager may temporarily shift money from one asset class to another to\nexploit discrepancy in market with a view to earn returns. In TAA, portfolio managers time\nmarkets, i.e., determine which asset classes are likely to go up more than expected and which\nless than expected. Then they will alter the target asset allocation accordingly. Thus, if a\nportfolio manager believes that the stock market is overvalued and is up for a correction,\nwhile debt market is undervalued, may reduce the proportion of the portfolio that is allocated\nto equities and increase the proportion allocated to debt. After booking the gains, the\nportfolio needs to be rebalanced to pursue the target allocation. Thus, TAA attempts to beat\nthe markets. Thus, SAA decisions involve \"time in the market\" whereas TAA is for \"timing the\nmarkets\".\n\n\n## 15.16.1 Importance of Asset Allocation decision – empirical support\n\n\n## Asset allocation is considered as the most important investment decision. This is because\nasset allocation is the major determinant of risk and return for a given portfolio. There is a\nhuge empirical support for the same. Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986) in a landmark\npaper concluded that a portfolio's target asset allocation explained the majority of a broadly\ndiversified portfolio's return variability over time. These findings were confirmed by Ibbotson,\nRoger G., and Paul D. Kaplan (2000) suggesting that a portfolio's investment policy is an\nimportant contributor to return variability. Across all portfolios, asset allocation decision\nexplains an average of 40 percent of the variation in fund returns. For a single fund, asset\nallocation explains 90 percent of the fund's variation in returns over time.\n\n\n## 15.17 Rebalancing of Portfolio\n\n\n## Portfolio need to be continuously monitored and periodically rebalanced. The need for\nrebalancing arises due to price changes in portfolio holdings. Over time, asset classes produce\ndifferent returns that can change the portfolio's asset allocation. To keep the portfolio's\noriginal risk-and-return characteristics, the portfolio may require rebalancing. Portfolio may\nalso require re-balancing due to changes in investor's goals and objectives, risk tolerance etc.,\nThe IPS should include a policy regarding rebalancing the portfolio answering questions\nrelating to rebalancing like \"how often\" and \"how much\" i.e. the periodicity for portfolio\nrebalancing and the tolerance for deviation from target policy portfolio.\n\n\n## 15.17.1 Benefits and difficulties of rebalancing\n\n\n# Portfolio rebalancing involves a simple trade-off: the cost of rebalancing versus the cost of\nnot rebalancing. While deciding the frequency of rebalancing, the trade-off between the cost\nof doing it and not doing it is to be arrived at. If investor's target asset allocation is considered\n\n\n## 264",

However, rebalancing\ncosts need to be borne in mind.\n\n\n# There are two types of cost - transaction cost and tax cost. Transaction costs is the time and\nmoney costs like research cost, brokerage etc., for buying and selling securities. Relatively\nilliquid investments like private equity and real estate pose challenges in rebalancing as they\npose higher transaction costs. Rebalancing is comparatively easier with relatively more liquid\nasset like listed equities or government bonds. While rebalancing the portfolio, managers sell\nassets, usually the appreciated asset and buy usually depreciated assets. Portfolio managers\noften set price targets for buying and selling securities. Such actions attract tax liability, which\nalso should be kept in mind while deciding the frequency for rebalancing and the tolerance\nfor deviations. There may be opportunity cost as well.

Proper performance measurement should involve\nrecognition of both return and risk of investments.\n\n\n## 16.2 Rate of return measures\n\n\n## The most vital statistic in measuring the performance of a portfolio is the rate of return. Rate\nof return has many possible definitions. However, there is one possible definition for each\npurpose. So, one should make effort to obtain clarity about the purpose for which the\nperformance is to be measured and then look at an appropriate return measure.\n\n\n## 16.2.1 Holding period return\n\n\n## The most straightforward rate of return is the holding-period-return (HPR), popularly known\nas total return or point-to-point return. It equals the income generated by an investment plus\nthe change in value of the investment during the period the investment is held, over the\nbeginning value of the investment, expressed as a percentage per annum.\n\n\n## For example, If the market value of an investor's portfolio on 1 April, 2018, is Rs.1,00,000, and\non 31 March, 2019 the market value of the same portfolio stands at Rs.1,20,000, the investor\nwould have achieved a holding-period return equal to 20%. In general, we can use Equation\n(1) to compute holding-period returns.\n\n\n## HPR=(E-B)/B\n\n\n## Equation 1\n\n\n## HPR=((120000-100000))/100000=20\\%\n\nFurther, assume that during the same period the investor has received Rs. 5000 by way of\n\n\n## dividend and interest income, then\n\n\n## 266",

First choice produces\na holding-period rate of return of -50 percent in the first year and 100 percent in the second\nyear. Another choice produces holding-period rate of return of 10 percent in the first year\nand 10 percent in the second year. Which one would you suggest?\n\nIn case of the first scheme at the end of the second year the investor will end up with Rs.\n\n\n## 100,000. The value of the portfolio is the same, as it was two years ago, though the average\nannual return on the portfolio is 25 percent.\n\n\n## With the second choice the value of the portfolio at the end of the second year is Rs.121,000;\nan average annual 10 percent gain in value. Clearly, investor is better off with the second\nscheme, although it produces average annual return lower than the first scheme.\n\n\n## To understand how the outcomes in the two cases are so different, it is important to\ndistinguish the two methods of calculating returns. The average annual arithmetic return is\nthe simple average of individual total yearly returns. The yearly return is the sum of (1) the\npercentage gain (or loss) in the value of your portfolio due to changes in asset prices and (2)\nany dividends or other cash distributions, expressed as the percent of invested assets.\n\nThe arithmetic mean is the “simple average” of a series of returns, calculated by summing all\n\nof the returns in the series and dividing by the number of values.\n\n\n## For the first choice the AMR = (-50\\%+100\\%)/2=25\\%\n\n\n## For the second choice the AMR =(10\\%+10\\%)/2=10\\%\n\n\n## The best estimate of a future year's return based on a random distribution of the prior years'\nreturns is the arithmetic average. Statistically, it is our best guess for the holding-period return\nin a given year. If we wish to estimate the expected return over a multiyear horizon\nconditioned on past experience, we may use the arithmetic average.\n\n\n# The second method of calculating returns is the average annual geometric or compound\nreturn. The average geometric return is far more important than the average arithmetic\nreturn if one is analyzing the long-run return on assets. The average annual geometric return\nis the rate at which the sum you invested at the beginning of the period will accumulate to a\ngiven sum at the end of the period by the process of compounding, or continuously\nreinvesting your dividends and capital gains. A characteristic of the compound return is that\nit depends only on the initial and final values of the portfolio, not on the path by which that\n\n\n## value was realized.\n\nGMR is based on an exponential function, which represents periodic compounding.\n\n\n## The process of calculating the GMR is the same as TWRR. We are required to calculate wealth\nrelatives for each HPR. Then we have to link these sub period returns.\n\n\n## 271",

Risk measures\n\n\n## Risk is the key dimension of performance measurement, and a decisive factor in selecting a\nportfolio manager.\n\n\n## 16.3.1. Total risk and downside risk\n\n\n## Risk in a generic sense is the possibility of loss, damage, or harm. For investments more\nspecific definitions of risk can be given.\n\nIt can be defined as variability in the expected return - total risk. Or, it can be limited to losses\n\n\n## or worse than expected outcomes only - downside risk.\n\n\n## Two possible measures of risk have received support in theory to capture total risk: the\nvariance and the standard deviation of the estimated distribution of expected returns.\nWhereas downside risk includes concepts such as semi-variance/standard deviation and\ntarget semi variance/standard deviations.\n\n\n## 16.3.2. Portfolio risk versus individual risk\n\n\n## Standard deviation or variance of the returns is used as measure of risk. While computing\nportfolio risk, it is to be borne in mind that portfolio standard deviation is not the weighted\naverage standard deviation of individual investments in a portfolio (except when these\ninvestments have perfect positive correlation with each other, which is practically an\nimpossibility). Portfolio risk depends on the weights of the investments, their individual\nstandard deviations and more importantly the correlation across those investments.\n\n\n## 278",

These factors affect all investments irrespective of their business sector.\nThe degree of impact may be different. Market risk is measure by Beta. Market risks cannot\nbe diversified away, though it can be hedged.\n\n\n## 16.3.4 Interpreting volatility\n\n\n# Standard deviation as a measure of total risk:\n\n\n## Standard deviation and variance are measures of dispersion in return. Standard deviation is\nthe square root of variance. It quantifies the degree to which returns fluctuate around their\naverage. A higher value of standard deviation means higher risk.\n\n\n## Standard deviation is used probably more than any other measure to describe the risk of a\nsecurity (or portfolio of securities).\n\n\n## In any academic study on investment performance; chances are that standard deviation will\nbe used to gauge risk. It's not just a financial tool, though. Standard deviation is one of the\nmost commonly used statistical tools in the sciences and social sciences.\n\n\n## One of the strengths of standard deviation is that is can be used across board for any type of\nportfolio with any type of security. The calculation is the same for a portfolio of bonds as it\nis for a portfolio of growth stocks or any other type of investments.\n\n\n## Standard deviation allows portfolios with similar objectives to be compared over a particular\ntime frame. It can also be used to gauge how much more risk a fund in one category has versus\nthe other.\n\n\n## Semi variance / Semi Standard deviation as a measure of downside risk:\n\n\n## Semi variance measures the dispersion of the return below the mean return. That is, this\nmeasures the variability of negative returns in an investment / identify downside risk.\nTarget Semi variance measures the dispersion of the return below the target return. In case\nof symmetrically distributed return, semi variance will be proportional to variance and\nprovides no additional insight. Forecasting asymmetrical distribution of return is very difficult\nand may not be a good forecast of future risk. Due to these reasons' semi variance is not so\npopularly used in practice.\n\n\n## 279",

Generally, indices are used to benchmark portfolios. Lower\nthe tracking error, closer are the returns of the portfolio are to the target Index. If the\nbenchmark portfolio is the market portfolio, tracking error measures deviations from the\nmarket return. Tracking Error is always calculated against the Total Returns Index which\nshows the returns on the Index portfolio, inclusive of dividend. Tracking errors primarily arises\ndue to mismatches between portfolio's risk profile and the benchmark's risk profile. There is\nanother concept called tracking difference. Tracking difference is layman's approach - just the\nsimple point-to-point difference between index return and fund return.\n\n\n## 16.3.6 Systematic Risk and Unsystematic Risk\n\n\n## Systematic risk is defined as risk due to common risk factors, like interest rates, exchange\nrates, commodities prices. It is linked to supply and demand in various marketplaces. All\ninvestments get affected by these common risk factors directly or indirectly. Systematic risks\ncannot be diversified away, though it can be hedged. Systematic risk is measured by Beta.\nRisks due to sector specific/company specific factors is referred as unsystematic risks. These\nrisks can be diversified away. Alpha return is a reward for bearing unsystematic risk.\n\n\n## 16.3.7 Beta\n\n\n## Systematic risk is measured by Beta. Beta relates the return of a stock or a portfolio to the\nreturn on market index. It reflects the sensitivity of the fund's return to fluctuations in the\nmarket index.\n\n\n# The relationship between the Beta of an individual security with portfolio of securities is\nlinear. Beta of the portfolio can also be calculated by taking the weighted average beta of the\nindividual securities/investments in the portfolio. Thus, if stock A has a beta of 1.2 and stock\nB has a beta of 1.1 and they make up the portfolio in the ratio of 60:40, the Beta of the\nportfolio would be:\n\n\n## Bp=0.60x1.2+0.40x1.1 = 1.16\n\n\n## Beta is fairly easy to interpret. A beta that is greater than one means that the portfolio or\nstock is more volatile than the benchmark index, while a beta of less than one means that\nthe security is less volatile than the index.\n\n\n## 16.3.8 Liquidity risk\n\n\n# Liquidity is defined as ease of converting an asset into cash at close to its economic worth.\nThe more difficult is conversion, the more is liquidity risk. Liquidity risk is the uncertainty\nintroduced by the secondary market of an investment. Treasury bills have almost no liquidity\nrisk. They can be sold in a fraction of minute at a price worth their economic value. On the\n\n\n## 280\n\n\n<!-- Page 281 -->\n\n\n## other hand, a piece of art may take longer to get converted into cash and the price may\ndeviate significantly from its worth.\n\n\n# 16.3.9 Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that the borrower is not able to repay the amounts on time to the lender.\n\n\n## In case of debt instruments the borrower is able to access funds for the time duration fixed\n\nin the instrument. At the end of the period the amount has to be returned to the lender. A\n\ndeterioration in the financial condition can lead to a situation where the amount cannot be\n\nrepaid and this is the credit risk for the lender. Credit risk arises in case of debt instruments.\n\n\n## 16.4\n\n\n## Risk-adjusted return measures\n\n\n## The differential return earned by the portfolio manager may be due to difference in the\nexposure to risk. Hence it is imperative to adjust the return for the risk. The following are the\npopularly used risk-adjusted return measures. These risk-adjusted performance measures\nassess the performance of a fund in terms of return per unit of risk.\n\n\n# 16.4.1 Sharpe Ratio:\n\n\n## One approach is to calculate portfolio's return in excess of the risk-free return and divide the\nexcess return by the portfolio's standard deviation. This risk adjusted return is called Sharpe\nratio. This ratio named after William Sharpe. It measures Reward to Variability.\n\n\n# S=\\frac{(R_{p}-R_{F})}{\\sigma_{p}}\n\n\n## Here,\n\n\n# R_{p}= Return of the portfolio\nR_{f}= Risk-free return\n\n\n## Sigma p= Standard deviation of return on the portfolio\n\n\n## It is to be noted that these three variables should be for the same period. Generally,\nannualized return and annualized standard deviation is taken for computing Sharpe ratios of\nthe portfolio, for easy comparison across portfolios.\n\n\n## Suppose the annualized standard deviation of the portfolio is 6.50%. Suppose that the\nannualized return for the same portfolio is 10.50%. The risk-free rate of return is 5.50%.\n\n\n# Then the Sharpe ratio for the portfolio is:\n\n\n## (10.50\\%-5.50\\%)/6.50\\%=0.7692\n\n\n## 281",

A fund with a higher Sharpe ratio in relation to another is preferable as it\nindicates that the fund has generated return for every unit of risk.\n\n\n## As can be noted Sharpe ratio adjusts return to the total portfolio risk. Hence it is a useful\nmeasure of performance for several mutually exclusive portfolios.\n\n\n## The Sharpe ratio is the simplest measure to compute and that is why it is the most widely\nused risk-adjusted return measure. However, it has a disadvantage: It Ignores diversification\npotential of portfolio.\n\n\n# 16.4.2 The Treynor Ratio\n\n\n## The Treynor measure adjusts excess return for systematic risk. It is computed by dividing a\nportfolio's excess return, by its beta as shown in equation\n\n\n# T=\\frac{(R_{p}-R_{F})}{\\beta_{p}}\n\n\n## where\n\n\n## T= the Treynor measure,\n\n\n## R_{p}= portfolio return,\n\n\n## R_{f}= riskless return and\n\n\n## B_{p}= portfolio beta.\n\n\n## As can be seen the numerator of the equation remains the same as in case of Sharpe ratio.\nThe denominator standard deviation is replaced by Beta.\n\nSuppose in the above case, beta of the fund is precisely 1. The Treynor ratio of the funds\n\n\n## would be:\n\n\n## Treynor~Ratio=\\frac{(10.50\\%-5.50\\%)}{1}=0.05\n\n\n## This indicates that the fund has generated 0.05-percentage point excess returns for every unit\nof systematic risk.\n\n\n## Like Sharpe ratio it is a measure of relative performance. It enables investors to compare\nacross investment opportunities. A fund with a higher Treynor ratio in relation to another is\npreferable as it indicates that the fund has higher risk premium for every unit of market risk.\n\n\n## 282",

For a completely well-diversified portfolio,\nthe two measures give identical ranking, because total risk and systematic risk would be the\nsame.

Modigliani and Modigliani Ratio (M2) Measure:\n\n\n## Franco Modigliani and his granddaughter Lea Modigliani (1997) derived another risk-adjusted\nperformance measure.

For such a risk adjusted portfolio, they calculated the return, and compared\nit with the market return to determine portfolio's over or underperformance. To adjust the\nrisk of the portfolio, they resorted to levering or de-levering.\n\n\n## After the standard deviations have been equalized, return can be directly compared with the\nreturn in the market. A high (low) indicates that the portfolio has outperformed or has\ngenerated a surplus (under-performed or generated a shortfall) the market portfolio.\n\n\n## Suppose the Portfolio has generated a return of 35%.

After measuring the performance, next\nimportant step is to evaluate it against some suitable benchmark or similar portfolios to\naddress more important issues like how the returns measure up to the comparable\ninvestment opportunities.

It is a standard or point of reference. It is a collection of investment\nopportunities or securities or risk factors which represent the investment characteristics and\ninvestment approach of the portfolio being evaluated against it.\n\n\n## Indices make popular choices for benchmarking portfolio. The number and variety of available\nindices make selection of suitable benchmarks a daunting task. A good benchmark increases\nthe proficiency of performance evaluation hence while choosing an index as benchmark care\nshould be taken to ensure that it is representative of the portfolio.\n\n\n## A good benchmark should be able to satisfy the following criteria:\n\n\n## •\n\nThe identity of constituents and their weights in the benchmark are clearly defined.\n\n- The benchmark is investable, in other words it is possible to have a passive exposure to\nthe same.\n\n\n## •\n\n\n## The benchmark is consistent with the portfolio's investment approach. For example, if the\nportfolio's investment approach is to invest in blue-chip stocks, the benchmark should\nalso consist of blue-chip stocks. If the investment style of the portfolio is value investing,\nthe benchmark should be of the same orientation.\n\n- The benchmark is having the same risk-return profile as the portfolio\n- The performance of the benchmark is measurable.\n\n\n# 16.5.2 Customized Benchmark:\n\n\n## Sometimes market-based indices may not meet the above criteria of a good benchmark, given\nthe portfolio manager's investment strategies and style. Such situation demands for\nappropriate customized benchmark. When the portfolio managers follow a certain type of\ninvestment strategy and style, they create an investment universe reflecting the same to\nfocus their research activities. The portfolio managers then select the most attractive\nsecurities from the investment universe. Such investment universes can act as benchmarks\nfor portfolio evaluation when market-based indices are not found to be valid. The advantage\nof such benchmarks is that they meet the requirement of valid benchmarks. The disadvantage\nis that the costs of construction and maintenance of these benchmarks would be much higher\nthan the fee paid for using market-based indices.

Often there is a change in the style of\ninvestment or its exposure and if this is radically different then the benchmark for this also\nneeds to change.\n\n\n# The benchmark sometimes might not be easily investible which means that it might be\ndifficult to replicate it. This leads to problems in having a portfolio similar to it. The benchmark\nshould not be witnessing huge changes in its components otherwise this would need to be\nreviewed for its effectiveness. The data for the benchmark should also be available.\nIncreasingly the Total Return Index is a measure that is being used and if this kind of data is\nnot available for the benchmark then it might not be able to give the correct picture.\n\n\n## 16.5.4 Managers' universe analysis\n\n\n# Managers' universe analysis or peer group analysis is also a very popular way of conducting\nperformance evaluation. The median portfolio or the universe of investments with similar\ninvestment approach and strategies can be taken as the yardstick to evaluate the\nperformance of the portfolio.

There are different\nways of doing the attribution analysis. Performance attribution in simple words\nis analysing what is driving the performance and the reasons behind this\nso that the investor is able to take further investment decisions. The underlying theme\nbehind various attribution analysis approaches is to dissect the return into majorly two\ncomponents: return driven by the benchmark and the differential return. The other\npart consists of identifying and quantifying the sources of differential return to primarily\nestablish whether it was driven by skill of the portfolio manager or some random factors (in\nlayman terms luck).\n\n\n## 16.6.1Assets and Sector Allocation\n\n\n# Differential return can be achieved by choosing to over-invest in (or being overweight) a\nparticular economic sector that outperformed the total benchmark (sector allocation) for that\nperiod or to underinvest in or avoid (or being underweight) an asset category that\nunderperformed the total benchmark (asset allocation).

There are\nseveral individual factors that affect the performance of a security and being able to have an\nexposure to the winners is another factor that leads to a better performance. Even avoiding\nthe poor performing securities can lead to a big improvement in the overall relative\nperformance of the portfolio.\n\n\n## 16.6.3 Market timing versus selectivity\n\n\n## Market timing is the ability of the fund manager to anticipate developments in the market\nand then invest to take advantage of these and generate superior performance. Selectivity on\nthe other hand is the ability of the fund manager to select securities that will generate extra\nreturns. There has long been a debate over which way is the route to generate extra returns.\nMost studies have shown that market timing is not the factor resulting in better performance.\nThe results are mixed on the selectivity front with some having this ability.\n\n\n## 16.6.4 Net selectivity\n\n\n## The Net selectivity measure of Fama is an absolute measure of performance. It is calculated\nas the annualised return of the fund less the yield of a risk free investment. This figure is then\nreduced by the standardised expected market premium times the total risk of the portfolio\nunder review. It shows the excess return earned by the fund manager that cannot have been\nearned by investing in the market portfolio.\n\n\n## 16.6.5. Local currency versus foreign currency denominated investment return\n\n\n## An Indian investor who buys and sells securities that are denominated in currencies other\nthan the Indian rupee needs to calculate the return after adjusting for the fluctuation in Indian\nrupee against those foreign currencies. The return earned on investments denominated in\nforeign currencies would not be the same when converted back to rupee term. The\nfluctuations in currency values can either enhance or reduce the returns associated with\nforeign investments. This is called currency risk.\n\n\n# Consider the following scenario:\n\n\n# An Indian investor has invested in an US equity fund a sum of Rs. 50 lacs when Rupee was 70\nper US dollar.

Similarly, a depository allows\nthe investors to hold their securities in electronic rather than physical form and provides\nservices related to transaction in securities.\n\n\n## The Depositories Act was passed in 1996 which allow companies and investors to issue, hold\nand transact in securities through a depository. There are currently two depositories\noperational in India, National Securities Depository Ltd. (NSDL) & Central Depository Services\n(I) Ltd. (CDSL). The securities can be dematerialised at the time of issue or subsequently. SEBI\nRegulations requires all public issues whose size is in excess of Rs. 10 crores to be issued only\nin dematerialised form. Investors in mutual funds can either ask for a demat issuance of units,\nor convert their holdings into demat mode. However, they are free to hold them in physical\nform. To clarify, it is not physical per se as there is no physical unit certificate like physical\nshare certificate of earlier days. It comes in the form of Statement of Accounts.\n\nCompanies are required to apply to a depository for dematerialising their securities.\n\n\n# Under the SEBI (Depository and Participants) Regulations of 1996 the categories of securities\neligible for dematerialisation are:\n\n- Shares, scrips, stocks, bonds, debentures, debenture stock or other marketable security of\nany incorporated company or other body corporate.\n- Units of a mutual fund, rights under a collective investment scheme, venture capital funds,\ncertificates of deposit, commercial paper, money market instruments, government securities\nand unlisted securities.\n\n\n## As per the Depositories Act, 1996, the physical securities that are dematerialised are required\nto be destroyed by the R&T agent and a credit entry is made in the electronic records of the\ndepository. The dematerialised securities are fungible. This means that once a share is\ndematerialised, it does not have a distinctive identity in terms of share certificate number or\ndistinctive numbers or folio numbers. The investor's ownership of the security is described in\nterms of number of shares held. In the depository, the dematerialised securities are identified\nin terms of the ISIN¹9(International Securities Identification Number) and the number of\nshares.\n\n\n## 17.3.1 Dematerialisation\n\n\n## 19The ISIN is a 12-character long identification code. It has three components--a pre-fix, a basic number and a check digit.\nSecurities issued by the same company, issued at different times or carrying different rights, terms and conditions are\nconsidered different securities for the purpose of allocating ISIN and are allotted distinct ISINS.\n\n\n## 303",

It\ninvolves the investor, the DP, the issuer/R&T agent and the depository.\n\n\n# The steps in this are:\n\n- Investor hands over the securities to be dematerialised along with the Dematerialisation\nRequest Form (DRF) to the DP.\n- The DP sends the request through the electronic system to the issuer/R&T agent and the\ndepository. The Dematerialisation Request Number (DRN) that is generated by the system is\nentered on the DRF and sent along with the physical documents and a standard covering\nletter to the R&T agent.\n- The certificates received by the R&T agent will be mutilated and have the words\n'Surrendered for Dematerialisation\" on it.\n\n\n# The R&T agent has to verify that:\n\n- The DRF has the DP's authorization\n- The dematerialisation request has been received in electronic as well as physical form.\n- The DRN in the physical documents matches with the DRN in the electronic request.\n- The certificates have the distinguishing marks such as hologram/water mark.\n- The mutual fund account statements have all the complete details and match with ISIN\nprovided in the demat form.\n\n\n## The R&T agent will verify the physical documents with the details in the covering letter and\nDRF and forward the documents for dematerialisation. The process of giving effect to\ndematerialisation by the R&T agent is similar to that of transfer of registered ownership. The\ndata to be captured, reports to be generated, documents to be filed are similar. In the Register\nof Members (ROM) of the company, the depository's name is included in the place of the\ninvestor to the extent of securities dematerialised. However, no stamp duty is payable on\ndematerialisation unlike other transfer of ownership transactions. Once the RoM of the\ncompany is amended, confirmation is sent to the depository and the investor's account with\nthe DP is credited with the number of dematerialised shares.\n\nA dematerialisation request may be fully or partially rejected for some of the following\n\n\n## reasons:\n\n- Mismatch in the information between the DRF and physical certificates.\n- Certificates are fake, stolen or for which duplicates have been issued.\n- Securities stand in a different name(s) from that mentioned in the DRF.\n- The Securities do not pertain to the issuer/R&T agent.\n- Signature of the holders does not tally with the records of the R&T agent.\n\n\n## The R&T agent mutilates the physical certificates once the process of dematerialisation is\ncomplete. The details of the certificate destroyed are entered into the Register of Destroyed\n\n\n## 304",

The DRFs are required\nto be stored for at least a period of 5 years.\n\n\n## 17.3.2 Rematerialisation of Securities\n\nRematerialisation of securities is the process of converting the electronic holding of a security\nto physical form.\n\n\n# The steps involved in this process are:\n\n- Investor submits a Rematerialisation Request Form (RRF) to the DP.\n- The DP validates the signature and the availability of the shares in free form in the investor's\naccount.\n- The request is then electronically forwarded to the depository.\n- The RRF will have details such as the name(s) of the holder(s), signature, Number of shares\nto be rematerialized, address, bank account details, PAN Number, age, tax status and\nnominees, if any.\n- The depository validates the information and forwards an electronic request through the\ndepository system to R&T. This can also be viewed by the DP.\n- The DP sends the RRF to the Issuer/R&T agent who cross verifies it with the electronic\nconfirmation received from the depository and forwards it for processing.\n- Acknowledgement of this is sent to the DP.\n- The R&T agent will capture the information in the RRF and create a new folio or add to an\nexisting folio. The procedure to be followed is the same as that for creating a folio in other\ncircumstances.\n- The R&T agent will assign a new certificate number and distinctive numbers from the set of\nshares already dematerialised.\n- The names of the beneficial owners will be included in the Register of members of the\ncompany and the name of the depository removed to that extent.\n\n\n## 305",

This facility is generally used by non-\nresident investors who stay in a foreign country and are thus unable to manage their financial\ntransactions, or by investors who like their brokers or advisors to manage their investments\non their behalf.\n\n\n## A Power of Attorney has two parties: the grantor, who is the primary investor or account\nholder and grants the rights; and the Attorney, or holder, who is authorised to execute an\nagreed set of actions on behalf of the grantor. The grantor and the holder have to abide by\nthe guidelines for PAN and KYC compliance. Power of attorney holders usually exercise all the\nrights of an investor. They can do normal transactions such as purchase, payment for\npurchase, sale, settlement of transactions and redemptions. The rights of the holder depend\non what the grantor is willing to delegate under the power of attorney and what is allowed\nfor PoA transactions by the investment or service provider. However, the attorney cannot\nappoint a nominee for the investment. The grantor of power of attorney can continue to\noperate the account even after giving a power of attorney.\n\n\n# To be valid the PoA must be:\n\n\n## Typed on a non-judicial stamp paper.\n\n- Stamped according to the rules applicable in the state in which it is executed.\n* Signed by the grantor on all pages.\n- Signed by the grantor and the holder of the power of attorney on the last page.\n- Notarised by a notary public. This requirement varies among different entities and\nintermediaries. For example, some mutual funds may require the PoA to be notarized, while\na PoA to operate a demat account needs to notarized only if the depository participant so\nrequires.\n\n\n## If the Power of Attorney is executed abroad, it can be typed on a plain paper, attested by a\ndesignated official of the Indian embassy abroad or by a notary abroad, signed on all pages\nby the grantor and sent to India for the holder of the power of attorney to sign on the last\npage. It is then stamped and notarized in India, if required.\n\n\n## 306",

A POA holder cannot open or close a bank or a\ndemat account. The signatures of the holders of the account are necessary for this. The holder\nof the PoA can operate the account on the basis of the rights granted. In case of investments\nsuch as mutual funds, POS schemes, the PoA holder can make the initial investments and\nsubsequent purchases and operate the account on behalf of the grantor. The grantor's\nsignature is also recorded in the folio for purposes of verification. Typically, the grantor of the\nPoA can also conduct the transactions for which the PoA has been granted. A POA holder\ncannot make or change nominations in an account or investment.\n\n\n## 17.4.1 General Power of Attorney\n\n\n# A General Power of Attorney gives the agent the authority to handle all the affairs during a\nperiod of time when the investor is unable to do so, such as when he is travelling out of the\ncountry or when his physical and/or mental health are compromised. A General Power of\nAttorney is typically very broad, giving the agent extensive powers and responsibilities.\nGeneral Power of Attorney typically includes (but is not limited to):\n\n- Handling banking and other transactions\n- Filing tax returns\n\n\n## *\n\n\n## Buying, selling, or managing real estate and other property\n\n- Entering contracts\n- Settling claims\n\n\n## 17.4.2 Specific Limited Power of Attorney\n\n\n## A Specific Power of Attorney gives the agent the authority to conduct a specific act or acts on\nthe investor. Because this type of Power of Attorney is limited to the act or acts designated in\nthe document, it is especially important to be very clear about the powers one wishes to give\nto the agent.\n\n\n## One may use a Special Power of Attorney to appoint an agent to act on his behalf in the event\nthat if he becomes ill or disabled, are embarking on extended travel, or are otherwise unable\nto handle a specific type of task. He may designate any of the powers listed above (under\nGeneral POA) to the agent, or any other powers he deems necessary.\n\n\n## 17.5 Account Opening Process for Non-Residents\n\n\n# 'Non-resident Indian' is an individual who is a citizen of India or a person of Indian origin and\nwho is not a resident of India.

As per section 6 of the Income-tax Act, an individual is said to be non-\nresident in India if he is not a resident in India and an individual is deemed to be resident in\nIndia in any previous year if he satisfies any of the following conditions:\n\n- If he is in India for a period of 182 days or more during the previous year; or\n- If he is in India for a period of 60 days or more during the previous year and 365 days or\nmore during 4 years immediately preceding the previous year.\n\n\n## However, condition No. 2 (mentioned above) does not apply where an individual being citizen\nof India or a person of Indian origin, who being outside India, comes on a visit to India during\nthe previous year.\n\n\n## A person shall be deemed to be of Indian origin if he, or either of his parents or any of his\ngrand-parents, was born in undivided India.\n\n\n## An NRI under Indian Income Tax Act is defined as a Person of Indian Origin (PIO) if he or she:\n* Has held an Indian passport at any time, or\n\n- Is a grandchild of citizens of India, or\n\n\n## *\n\n\n## Is a spouse of an Indian citizen, or\n\n*Is a spouse of a person covered under the first two points above\n\n\n## In terms of Regulation 2 of FEMA Notification No.13 dated May 3, 2000, Non-Resident Indian\n(NRI) means a person resident outside India who is a citizen of India. NRI investors, including\nPersons of Indian Origin and FPIs, are allowed to invest in India. The key issue in NRI\ninvestment pertains to repatriation of investment proceeds on sale or redemption of units.\nRepatriation norms vary depending upon the source of the funds from which the original\ninvestment was made. NRIs can earn income in rupees from India, or in foreign currency from\nanother country. If the source of funds for an NRI investment is foreign currency, it can be\nfreely taken outside the country; that is, it is repatriable. If the source of funds is Indian\nRupees, it is non-repatriable. Investment made from these two sources of income cannot be\nclubbed together.\n\n\n## The reason for the rupee investment proceeds being non-repatriable is that since the rupee\nis not fully convertible on capital account, RBI norms do not permit investment in Indian\nrupees to be freely converted to other world currencies and to be taken out in foreign\ncurrency.\n\n\n# Since the treatment of investment proceeds from NRI investment depends on the source of\nfunds, the source has to be identified at the time of making the investment. The bank account\nthrough which the investment is routed is used to determine the source of funds. The funds\nthat are remitted from abroad into the Non Resident External (NRE) Account or Foreign\nCurrency Non Resident (FCNR) Account and invested can be freely repatriated back. NRI\ninvestors have to give a declaration in the application form about the type of account from\n\n\n## 308",

A loan can also be\ntaken against a life insurance policy by assigning the policy to the lender or to the insurance\ncompany itself if the loan is taken from the company. The lender will create a lien or charge\non the securities pledged with them. The investor cannot redeem the securities under lien. If\nthey fail to pay the loan amount the lender can sell the securities and recover their dues.\n\n\n# The investor and the lender must inform the investment provider, such as the mutual fund,\nbank, insurance company, depository participant or insurance company of the lien through a\nletter. In some cases, such as assignment in an insurance policy or for savings certificates,\nthere may be a specified form for the purpose. Typically, the information that requires to be\nprovided in creating a charge includes:\n\n\n## *The folio number, account number, certificate number, FDR number, demat account\nnumber, insurance policy details of the investments offered as security.\n\n- The scheme / plan / option if applicable\n- The number of units/securities pledged with ISIN as applicable\n*The details of the bank account of the financier or lien holder.\n\n\n## 314",

The lien appears as a transaction in the\naccount statement. Lien can be for all or part of the securities in a folio.\n\n\n## An investor cannot redeem or transfer the securities under lien until the lien holder provides\na written authorisation to revoke the lien or pledge. The investor can conduct transactions\nsuch as change in address or bank details, unless specifically denied by the lien holder. Once\nthe investor repays the loan, the securities become free from lien and are unmarked. For\nunmarking of lien, the lien holder should send a written communication to the company. If\nthe request for unmarking is sent by the pledger or the holder of the investments, then the\napplication must also be signed by the pledgee or the lender. Dividends and other benefits\nfrom the securities under lien will go to the investor unless specifically barred by the lien\nholder.\n\n\n## As long as securities are under lien, the lien holder can exercise or invoke the lien. Invoking\nthe lien means redeeming or selling the pledged securities. The lien holder receives the\nproceeds by selling/redeeming the securities. There is no transfer of securities from the\ninvestor to the lien holder. The investor receives information about lien invocation through\nthe account statement. If the lien or charge is created on a bank fixed deposit, then the bank\nwill undertake to pay the amount of FDR to the lien holder in the event they exercise the lien.\nSimilarly, any payouts by the insurance company on a policy that has been assigned, will go\nto the assignee till the loan is repaid and the insurance company is so intimated.\n\n\n## 17.6.5 Transmission\n\n\n## Transmission means 'an act of passing on something'. In the context of investments, it refers\nto passing on the investments on the death of the investor to another person. To complete a\ntransmission process, on receiving a claim with documents to support it, the name of the\ninvestor is removed from investment records and the investment is transferred to persons\nentitled to receive them.\n\n\n# After the death of a person there may be several claimants to the investments made by the\ndeceased security holder. The investment provider or their agent such as an R&T agent of a\nmutual fund, do not take responsibility for the equitable distribution of the investments\namong the heirs of the deceased investor. They follow the directions of the original investor\nor follow a prescribed process if there is no such instruction. There could be joint holders,\n\n\n## 315",

The eligibility of claimants to get the investments\ntransmitted in their name on the death of the first holder will depend upon the way the\ninvestment account was held.

In the event the mode of operation of the account was specified as\neither or survivor, then it is passed on to the remaining holders.\n\n\n## If the folio was held jointly and had nominations, the right of the joint holders to\ntransmission supersedes the right of the nominee.\n\nIf the investment account was held singly (only one holder) and had a nomination,\nthen the investments will be transmitted to the nominee.\n\nIf the investment account was held singly and there was no nomination, then it would\n\n\n## be transmitted to legal heirs or other claimants where there are documents to\nestablish succession.\n\n\n## On the death of Karta of HUF, the investment will be transmitted to the new Karta on\nreceipt of indemnity bond signed by all the remaining co-parceners.\n\n\n## Companies take a sensitive approach to dealing with transmission cases. They explain the\ndocumentation correctly and completely to the claimants. In cases where the amount\ninvolved is not large, some of the requirements may also be waived. For example, DPs may\nnot insist on documents such as a succession certificate or the probate or letter of\nadministration, if the application for transmission is for securities whose value does not\nexceed Rs. 50,00020 A copy of the death certificate, letter of indemnity and NOC from other\nlegal heir is seen as adequate to process the transmission request. The threshold for simplified\ndocumentation for transmission in case of securities held in the physical form has been\nrevised to Rs.5 lakhs and in case of dematerialised securities the limit is Rs.15 lakhs.\n\n\n## The transmission of investments to the claimant is done on the assumption that if there is a\ndispute, the person holding the investment or redemption proceeds is only holding it in trust,\npending final settlement. Payment to the nominee or claimant as per the processes, absolves\nthe investment entity of its responsibilities.\n\n20 According to the depository bye-laws, if value of the securities in the deceased beneficial owner account is less than Rs. 5\nlakhs then the successor need not provide either the succession certificate Probate of the will / Letter of administration.\n\n\n## 316",

These categories of\nindividual investors require additional documentation and process, due to their differential\nstatus with respect to taxation and mode of operation of investments or restrictions on\ncertain components of investment activity.\n\n\n## 17.7.1 Minors as Investors\n\n\n## Minors are investors who are less than 18 years of age on the date of investment. Minors\ncannot enter into contracts on their own and if they, then such contracts are null and void by\nlaw. Therefore, the financial transactions of minors are conducted by adults on their behalf.\nThose transacting on behalf of the minor child are called guardians. Parents are the natural\nguardians of their minor children.

Depending on the\nrequirements of the investment product, the PAN of the minor or of the guardian or both may\nhave to be provided while making the investment.\n\n\n## The guardian of a minor may change due to demise of the existing guardian, or through\nmutual consent. When there is a change in guardian, an application has to be made for\nregistration of the new guardian. For this the new guardian has to send a request letter to the\ncompany along with prescribed documents. If the existing guardian is alive, a no objection\nletter or consent letter from existing guardian or a court order appointing the new guardian\nneeds to be submitted. If the previous guardian is deceased, a copy of the death certificate,\nduly notarized or attested has to be submitted. Attestation may be done by a special\nexecutive magistrate or an authorized official of the Company, or manager of a scheduled\nbank.\n\n\n## The new guardian could be a natural guardian (mother or father), or a court appointed legal\nguardian. A court appointed legal guardian has to submit supporting documentary evidence.\nA natural guardian also has to submit documentation evidencing the relationship. The\nsignature of the new guardian in the bank account of the minor attested by the bank as such\nneeds to be submitted. The new guardian also needs to obtain KYC compliance and furnish\nevidence of the same to the asset management company.\n\n\n## A petition can be filed in the High Court under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, or the\nHindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956, by a person seeking to be a child's guardian, for\nbeing appointed as the legal guardian.\n\n\n## 17.7.2 Minor turned Major\n\n\n## Once the minor become major, financial transactions are disallowed in their account. No\ndebits or redemptions can be made in bank accounts; mutual funds folios or demat account\nof minors-turned-major until the change in KYC is completed. Minors are not eligible to sign\ndocuments, enter into contracts, or issue third party cheques. However, after a minor\nbecomes major, they can conduct such transactions, only after their signature is attested by\ntheir banker.\n\n\n## KYC: Minors attaining majority will have to complete all the KYC process by submitting proof\nof identity and address. Banks and depositories may also insist on personal verification of the\n\n\n## 320\n\n\n<!-- Page 321 -->\n\n\n## minor-turned-major. It is important to plan for such verification if the child is away at a\ndifferent location for higher studies.\n\n\n# Bank Accounts: Holding details for minor's investments will undergo change so that the\naccount is operable by the minor-turned major. Banks will ask for proof of age and ask for an\napplication to attest the signature of the minor-turned-major.\n\n\n## PAN Card: The PAN issued to a minor will have to be resubmitted to the Income Tax\nauthorities, for issuance of a new card, with the same number, but the new signature of the\nminor-turned-major.\n\n\n## Demat Account: Since demat accounts of minors can be held only on single-name basis, the\naccount opening process has to be redone for a minor-turned-major. This involves opening of\na new demat account. Securities held in the old demat account with minor status are\ntransferred to the new demat account. Depositories may waive transaction charges on such\ntransfers.\n\n\n## Mutual Fund Investments: In case of mutual fund investments, notification to the registrars,\nwith a copy of the banker's attestation of the signature is adequate. R&T agents make the\nchange in status, register the new signature and notify the investor. Minors can then operate\nthe folio or investment account and the guardian will not have any rights to the mutual fund\nfolio or demat account after this change has taken effect.\n\n\n## Systematic Transactions (SIP, SWP, STP and others): Standing instructions like Systematic\nInvestment Plans (SIP), Systematic Withdrawal Plans (SWP), Systematic Transfer Plans (STP)\nare registered in a minor folio only till the date of the minor attaining majority, even though\nthe instructions may be for an extended period. When the minor is approaching the age of\nmajority, AMCs usually send letters advising the guardian and the minor to submit the form\nalong with prescribed documents to change the status of the account/folio to \"major\". All SIP,\nSTP, SWP and any other standing instruction registered in the minor's account are suspended\nif the documents are not received by the date when the minor attains majority.

The NEFT and RTGS\nsystems of RBI allow transfer of funds electronically from the account of the remitter\nmaintaining an account in one bank to a beneficiary in his account maintained with another\nbank/branch. These facilities benefit investors who do not have internet banking accounts\nwith the designated banks specified. For a transfer to go through, both sending and receiving\nbanks have to be RTGS/NEFT enabled.\n\n\n## In order to perform a transaction using NEFT or RTGS, the Indian financial system code (IFSC)\nis necessary. IFSC is an eleven digit alphanumeric code and unique to each branch of a bank.\nThe first four letters indicate the identity of the bank and remaining seven numerals indicate\na branch. This code is provided on the cheque books.\n\n\n## The RTGS system is for transactions of Rs. 2 lakhs and above, so the online system will not\ndisplay the RTGS option for lower investment amounts. There is no minimum amount for\nNEFT transactions. In order to carry out a transfer of funds through NEFT or RTGS, the bank\naccount details of the beneficiary account holder including account number, bank and branch\nname and the IFSC code of the beneficiary bank branch have to be provided.\n\n\n## NEFT transfer takes place in batches at times defined by the RBI. RTGS transactions are settled\ncontinuously as and when they are put through on a real time basis. The charges under NEFT\nrange from Rs. 5 to Rs. 25 per transaction depending on the amount being transferred. In case\nof RTGS, the charges range from Rs. 5 to Rs. 55 per transaction. Goods and Services tax is\napplicable on these charges.\n\n\n## Even if an investor does not have access to internet banking, he can opt for RTGS or NEFT by\nfilling a request form and submitting at the bank branch with details of bank name, branch,\naccount number and type of account, and IFSC code of the scheme, along with name and\naddress of the fund. Once the request form is received, the bank will generate a unique\ntransaction reference number. The bank's acknowledgement for the transfer request has to\nbe appended along with the application as proof of transfer. The account number mentioned\nin the transfer instruction copy provided as proof should have one of the account holders as\nthe first holder.\n\n\n## Other digital payments available to the individual include the Unified Payment Interface (UPI),\nAadhaar Enabled Payment Service (AEPS), the National Unified USSD Platform, E wallets and\n\n\n## 326",

This was initiated in order to\nenhance the reach of mutual fund products amongst small investors, in particular those who\ndo not have bank accounts. Such cash applications should be in compliance with Prevention\nof Money Laundering Act, 2002, Rules and Circulars issued by SEBI, from time to time.\nAdditionally, the asset management company should have sufficient systems and procedures\nin place for accepting cash transactions. Though subscriptions in cash are allowed, repayment\nin the form of redemptions and dividends is only permitted through banking channels.\n\n\n## Third party payments or payments made through an instrument issued from a bank account\nother than that of the investor mentioned as the first holder in the application form, will not\nbe accepted for payment for investing in capital markets. In case of mutual fund investments,\nexceptions on the third party payment rule are made for grand-parents/parents making\npayments not exceeding Rs. 50,000 (per transaction) on behalf of a minor, employer making\npayments on behalf of employee through payroll deductions and custodians making\npayments on behalf of FPIs. A third-party declaration form in which the relationship with the\nbeneficiary has to be stated and details of the bank account through which payment will be\nmade has to be provided. This has to be attached to the application form. The person making\nthe third party payment must be compliant with the PAN and KYC requirements.\n\n\n## 17.8.4 Prevention of frauds\n\n\n## A very important part of the investment process is to ensure that the amounts being invested\nare safe from fraud. There have been several instances when the investor gave cheques for\ninvestment in a fund and the cheques went into the account of some other person, who then\nencashed the amount and disappeared. This is why the amount that is being invested would\nhave to come from the investors own account and not a third party.\n\n\n## Similarly, there is a bank account that is linked with the investment and this is meant to ensure\nthat the dividends and the redemption proceeds go to the right place. If this does not happen\nthen the investor would have no idea where their money has gone. Initially the cheques used\nto come with the name printed but this could be deposited in any account, so then the\naccount number was printed on them so they could not be deposited in some other account.\nNow the amount is credited directly into the investors bank account so this reduces the risk\nof the amount being stolen even further.\n\n\n## 327",

The suitability and success of\nthe plan will depend upon how effectively the information was captured, interpreted and\nacted upon. Clear documentation of the entire process will exclude chances of information\nbeing misinterpreted.

The SEBI\n(Investment Adviser) Regulations, 2013 prescribes the documentation essential to make the\nprocess of financial advice complete.\n\n\n## The investment adviser must enter into an agreement with the client laying out the roles and\nresponsibilities of each party. This should include the scope of the work that will be\nundertaken, the agreed remuneration and an undertaking by all parties to act in good faith.\nThe adviser must take the client through all the clauses and make sure they understand the\nimplications. A signed copy of the agreement must be available with both parties.\n\n\n## The adviser must collect information on the client that is essential to advising. This includes\nthe age, income and asset details, details on existing borrowings and liabilities and needs and\ngoals for which they wish to save and invest. This is fundamental information based on which\nthe financial plan will be made and it is best that it is recorded and verified by the client before\nit is used.\n\n\n## The suitability of investment products will depend upon the risk tolerance of the investor.\nThis can be assessed using risk profiling tools such as questionnaires. The adviser must ensure\nthat the investor understands the questions clearly. The interpretation of the responses must\nbe correctly done. The responses must be seen in conjunction with the financial and personal\nsituation of the client to arrive at the appropriate risk tolerance. The risk profile arrived at\nshould be communicated and explained to the client. All this information should be\nmaintained in records and periodically updated.\n\n\n## The investment adviser must document the process by which they short-list investment\nproducts for the client.

One way of transacting in the\nmutual fund units is to use the services of a distributor or complete the process with the\nmutual fund directly. An additional route has opened up for investors through the stock\nexchange platform route, where the recognised stock exchanges offer the facility to investors\nto buy and sell MF units through their platform.\n\n\n## There is an element of convenience that is available for investors, when they transact on the\nstock exchange. This is because the entire system is seamless and the investor is familiar with\nit. In case of stocks the investor needs to enter their order details either through their broker\nor online and these are routed to the stock exchange and then executed. The same route is\nfollowed for mutual fund units where the investor is able to transact in a seamless manner\nand get the units in their demat account.\n\n\n## SEBI has allowed mutual fund distributors to use the platform of recognized stock exchanges\nfor the purpose of buying and selling mutual fund units on behalf of their clients. One of the\nprimary conditions that has to be followed is that the distributor has to be registered with\nAssociation of Mutual funds in India (AMFI) to be able to use the infrastructure. The units are\npurchased from and redeemed with the Asset Management Companies (AMC) directly.\n\n\n## One of the main features of this platform is that the distributor only handles the transactions\nof the investor. The rest of the process, including the pay in and pay out of money as well as\n\n\n## 331",

This involves the clearing\ncorporation too, and this system eliminates counterparty risk.\n\n\n# The BSE and the NSE mutual fund platforms, called StAR and NMF II respectively, are examples\nof the two types of stock exchange platforms that are present for investors to use. The\nbeneficial part of this entire system is that apart from normal purchase and sale of units there\nis also the facility of undertaking a SIP which is a very crucial way of investing for investors.\nSTP (systematic transfer plan) and SWP (systematic withdrawal plan) transactions apart from\na switch are also possible on the stock exchange. The ease of making the investment and the\nfacility offered is also a reason why the investor might find this an attractive route to invest.\n\n\n## The investment on the stock exchange platform can be made in the demat form and also in\nthe physical form. When the investment is made online, there is no need for submission of\nthe documents, which has to be kept with the mutual fund intermediary. In case of a physical\napplication there is a need to submit the documents along with the application. It is easier to\nundertake the online transaction and hence this can be done quickly and the same time the\nunits will also be allocated immediately.\n\n\n## 17.10.2 Role of investment adviser\n\n\n## The investment adviser has the ability to make the process of investing easier because they\ncan advise on the use of the online platform for the mutual fund investments. Investors might\nalready be using the stock exchange for their equity exposure and at the same time they\nwould be having a demat account, so extending this to mutual fund purchases would be\neasier.\n\n\n## The adviser has to guide the investor on the manner in which the investment will be done and\nthe process that they need to follow. It could be that the investor has various questions on\nthe mode of operation of this system and it is the role of the investment adviser to answer\nthem. The manner in which the transaction will be undertaken and the allocation of units will\ntake place has to be understood by the investor.\n\n\n## The investment adviser while constructing the portfolio of the investor can also suggest the\nroute that they can take for the purpose of making the investment and this can be the stock\nexchange platform. This will depend on the convenience of the investor and hence this factor\nalso needs to be taken into the calculation.\n\n\n## 17.10.3 Transaction feed available to investment advisers\n\n\n## One of the biggest benefits for the investment advisers is that they are able to see the entire\nmutual fund portfolio of their clients at a single place. The stock exchange provides the details\n\n\n## 332",

This ensures\nthat the entire portfolio details are available at a single place.\n\n\n# There is also the facility in which the status of various transactions can be seen on the\nplatform. The portfolio holding statement can be generated as and when this is required,\nwhich helps in getting a proper view of the situation for the client. Other facilities include the\nclubbing of family members together so that they can be seen at the same place. It could be\nthat there is a need to change some non-financial information of the client then this can be\ndone through the stock exchange platform itself.\n\n\n## The investment adviser is thus able to take an independent view of the portfolio and make\ntheir decisions accordingly. It makes the decision-making process easier because of the\nwealth of information available. All details related to the investment is there so it is just a\nmatter of making the right decision based on this information.\n\n\n## There is almost no paperwork in the entire process and this makes the process quite smooth.\nThis is a benefit for the investment advisers as they can undertake a larger amount of business\nand thus are also able to service their clients in a better manner.\n\n\n## One of the main problems for clients is that when there is something that has gone wrong in\nthe process, it is very difficult to address and rectify. This becomes simpler to handle when\nthe stock exchange platform is used because all the information is available at a single place.\nThis will ensure that the service standard is also improved. It ensures effective transparency\nfor everyone present in the process. Ultimately the investment adviser is able to charge fees\nin the right manner and at the correct point.\n\n\n## There is also ease of payment through the system as payments are accepted through cheque,\ndemand draft, electronic modes like NEFT/RTGS, internet banking and even debit card.\n\n\n## 333",

In India, the Income Tax Act was amended\nin 2014 to enable financial institutions and other intermediaries to report to Central Board of\nDirect Taxes (CBDT) with respect to US persons. All Indian and NRI investors are required to\nfile a FATCA self-declaration. Intermediaries that are reporting financial institutions must\nupload FATCA and CRS self-certifications obtained from account holders to the KRA system\nstarting from 1 July 2024. The onus lies on reporting financial institutions to obtain respective\nself-certifications from account holders, verify their accuracy based on the information\nprovided, including any documentation obtained in accordance with Prevention of Money\nLaundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2005, and promptly update the self-certifications\nto the KRA system upon any changes.\n\n\n## Common Reporting Standards (CRS) is a part of the effort of Government of India for\nexchange of information between countries for prevention of tax evasion.\n\n\n# Reporting Financial Institution needs to review their financial accounts by applying due\ndiligence procedures to identify whether any of the financial account is a Reportable Account.\nIf any account is identified as a reportable account, then the Reporting Financial Institution\nshall report the relevant information in Form 61Bin respect of the identified reportable\naccount. The reporting obligation applies to entities which may be legal persons or legal\narrangements, such as a corporation, a trust, or a partnership etc. To determine whether an\nentity has a potential reporting obligation in India, it must be determined whether the entity\nis a Reporting Financial Institution (RFI). RFI are required to maintain and report certain\ninformation in respect of each \"Reportable Account\". RFI is defined in Rule 114F(7) to mean:-\n(a) a financial institution which is resident in India, but excludes any branch of such institution\n\n32https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/news/guidance-note-on-fatca-and-crs-may-2016.pdf\n\n\n## 363",

The goals of the client and the manner in which they will be achieved are a very\nimportant part of their lives. In matters related to money it is vital that there is ethical\nbehaviour of the highest standard. This is essential to build the necessary trust and confidence\nnot only for the investment adviser but also for the entire advisory and financial services\nindustry.\n\n\n## Ethics can be defined as several moral principles that decide and influence a person's\nbehaviour. It is thus an area that deals with what is good for society and individuals. The term\nis derived from the Greek word ethos which means custom, habit or character.\n\n\n## Ethics is also defined as a set of moral principles or rules of conduct that provide guidance for\nour behaviour when it affects others. Widely acknowledged fundamental ethical principles\ninclude honesty, fairness, diligence, care and respect for others.\n\n\n## There are several actions that people take in their day to day lives. This includes those related\nto money and financial activities. Doing things that are within the ambit of the law is one thing\nas this ensures that there is nothing illegal being done. But ethics goes one step beyond that\nas it brings into play what is right or wrong behaviour. It arises out of the basic values and\ncharacter that a person has. Ethics are often the result of a lifetime of beliefs and values.\n\n\n# On the other hand, there might be an Investment Adviser who might not provide any after-\nsales service to her clients even though this is essential and needs to be looked at carefully.\nThis clearly goes against the ethical principles that are required to be followed. Excuses might\n\n\n## 367",

At the same time there is a need to go beyond\nthis purpose and look at the bigger picture because this is what determines the values of a\ncertain society and the country in which it operates. Business has to be done ethically with\nthe right principles so that there is a moral support backing its actions. Investment advisers\nare in a unique position because their business needs the highest form of ethical conduct to\nearn the respect of the society at large.\n\n\n# The Investment adviser deals with the issue of giving advice on matters related to money and\nhence if they are conducting business in a manner that puts the interest of the client above\neverything else (Client First principle) they are on the correct ethical path. This has to be seen\nin actions over a period of time which will enable the clients and people to have confidence\nthat the investment adviser can be trusted. This trust is at the center of all the activities of an\ninvestment adviser because it can take years to build trust but just a few moments to lose it\n\n\n## all.\n\n\n## There has to be a feeling among clients and people at large that business is being done fairly\nand that this is not at the expense of others. This allows for the coexistence of the business\nwith other activities. Investment advisers have to ensure that their ethical standards put the\ninterest of the client above their self-interest i.e. there is no conflict of interest. If there is a\nfeeling that the investment adviser is looking out only for their own specific needs and interest\nthen it would be very difficult for them to gain the confidence of the people. This is one of the\nmost crucial factors in an advisory business that has to be developed over a period of time.\n\n\n## The investment adviser can proactively look at the needs of the clients and how they can\nbenefit from the existing situation, and this would be another factor that would benefit them\nin the long run. It should not be that the client has to keep asking for things which they would\nfind useful, but if the Investment adviser proactively suggests things that the client needs to\ndo then this becomes a big positive factor.\n\n\n## Business has a special place in society where people look up to business leaders for inspiration\nand this has to be maintained. It can only happen when the business is done with ethical\nprinciples. The investment adviser can attain a high level of respect and confidence of people\nin society at large only when they are conducting their activities in an ethical way. This will\ninvolve giving up short cuts and quick benefits for staying true to their principles. If someone\nis willing to trust you with his money matters, then he is expecting you to be the custodian of\nthat money and that is a lot of responsibility for anyone.\n\n\n## 368",

This will happen only when business is done in\nan ethical way. If these principles are not followed then the entire situation can come crashing\ndown, which would not only wipe out years of hard work but it could also make regaining it\nnext to impossible.\n\n\n## 19.3 Ethical issues for an Investment Adviser\n\n\n## The main role of a financial intermediary is channelizing the domestic savings into various\ninvestment vehicles available. On the one hand the intermediary helps the issuer in mobilizing\nresources for development/implementation of projects or investment in the capital market\nwhile on the other hand he helps the investor obtain a reasonable return on his investment.\nIn the Indian financial market, there are many products with complexities which the common\nman/the small investor may not understand. It is the financial intermediary who should take\nthe most suitable product to the retail investor that would serve the needs of the investor\nbest and help in fulfilling his financial goals. The intermediary plays a key role in the successful\nachievement of financial goals of many Indian families.\n\n\n## The financial intermediary should realize that he would be very successful if he focuses on his\nclients and the clients' needs rather than on his own needs. It would be useful for the\nintermediary to keep in mind this following very famous quotation of Zig Ziglar, the world\nrenowned corporate motivator: \"You can have everything in life you want; if you will just help\nother people get what they want\".\n\n\n## The intermediary many times works on targets and goes about selling financial products\naggressively to achieve the targets within a time frame. While doing this sometimes the\nsuitability of the product to the investor is lost sight of. The investor should be at centre of\nthe activity and his interest should be uppermost in the minds of the advisors. It is important\nfor the advisor/intermediary to nurture and take care of the financial well-being of his clients\nto reap long term benefits.\n\n\n## The main problems/investor grievance areas in the advisory business can be highlighted as\nunder:\n\n- Advisor's lack of focus on understanding client specific situations or needs so as to\nprovide appropriate advice. Sometimes, client's wishes and needs may differ. Risk\nprofiling is a must in such cases. As an example, Small Cap Funds for senior citizens\nmay not be appropriate.\n- Advisors' lack of understanding of the financial product which he is selling, especially\nthe risks involved and suitability for the client. This is addressed by explaining the\nproduct features, and making sure that the client has understood it, before making an\ninvestment. As an example, Arbitrage Funds are sold as Liquid Fund substitute. The\n\n\n## 369",

    "page_content": "<!-- Page 370 -->\n\n\n# drawdown / volatility track record over short horizons of say one week would show\nthe picture.\n\n- Advisors' lack of information about overall market and other available financial\nproducts enabling him to have relative valuation and understanding on pros and cons\nof the product universe. This too can be handled by educating the client or pointing\nthe client to relevant sources of knowledge. As an example, selling Small Cap Funds\nwhen the segment is rallying, has to be seen in perspective.\n- Adopting wrong practices like frequent switching from one product to another to\nincrease earnings from commissions i.e. churning. It is for this reason that SEBI has\nmandated that advisors can't distribute; but the problem could be prevalent in other\nchannels.\n- Not educating/informing the investor about risks; uncertainties about financial\nproducts that are sold, while highlighting only the good features of the product. This\nis largely about misrepresentation and not showing the risks to the clients. As an\nexample, Distress Debt Funds (AIF) carry a relatively higher default risk, which needs\nto be communicated to the investor.\n- Poor after sales service or deviating from what was promised earlier.\n\n\n# 19.4 Ethical Dilemma\n\n\n## An ethical dilemma is a situation where there is a problem and a person has to take a decision\nbetween two alternatives, neither of which is superior. The option that is chosen would reflect\nthe manner in which the ethical dilemma is resolved, and will also have implications in terms\nof the signal that this sends out. A series of such signals will re-enforce the client's perception\nof the investment advisor's ethical standards.\n\n\n## An ethical dilemma arises in virtually every field and profession in life. It is up to the person\nwho has to make the decision, to decide according to their moral beliefs and principles. This\nis especially true when it comes to an investment adviser because they will have several of\nsuch dilemmas in the course of their work.\n\n\n## For example, there might be a need for an adviser to earn some income so when a client\ncomes to them, they would be willing to serve the client. It could be that the client does not\nrequire a particular service, but does not know about it. In such a situation, the options before\nthe investment adviser are (a) make the client go through the process and earn some money\nor (b) tell the client that they need not do all the things suggested because it is not necessary\nfor them. This is a type of ethical dilemma, because option (a) will give the investment advisor\nrevenue, but option (b) is ethically correct.\n\n\n## There can be different categories of ethical dilemmas. A pure ethical dilemma could be one\nwhere there might be two alternatives and both of them could be against some ethical\nprinciple. So, no matter what choice is made there is going to be some violation of ethics.\n\n\n## 370\n\n\n<!-- Page 371 -->\n\n\n# An example for an Investment Adviser could be a situation wherein they want to increase\ntheir business. In such a situation the adviser can sign up a lot of clients, with the chance or a\nhigh probability that they would not be able to serve them in the manner that is required or\ndesired. The other choice would be to go slowly and build up a client list over a longer period,\nbut this could make their business unsustainable and unable to survive.\n\n\n## Another situation of an ethical dilemma arising would be when there is a clash between\npersonal values and professional values. This can be a very difficult situation as it would need\nto be resolved in a manner that takes care of these values and does not cause a huge\ndisconnect.\n\n\n## For example, there might be a personal value of an individual that they believe in only term\ninsurance policies for clients to meet their life cover needs. Term insurance provides for a\npayout only on death and the premium on such policies is low. They might be in employment\nwhere the need would be to promote other types of insurance policies because they earn\nmore income for the organization. Other types of insurance policies like Unit Linked Insurance\nPlans (ULIP)or whole life policies have a higher premium which leads to a higher commission\nfor the entity selling this. In such a situation they would need to tackle this ethical dilemma.\n\nThere are different ways in which these kinds of dilemmas can be tackled.\n\n\n## Deeper analysis of the entire matter is often one of the best ways to resolve the dilemma. On\na detailed analysis it often becomes clear that what seems to be a dilemma is actually a clear\ncase, where a specific course of action is the correct way to go ahead. This will end the\nproblem for the investment adviser as the route forward becomes clear for them to continue\nwith their efforts.\n\n\n## The other way to tackle such a dilemma is to have specific principles that would help resolving\nthe entire matter. It could be something like taking a step that does the highest amount of\ngood for all those involved. The other approach could be doing something that does the least\namount of damage. Either of the approaches might be the way to find a solution.\n\n\n## A distributor could be pushing a mutual fund when this has consistently been an\nunderperformer. It could be that a higher commission on the product is driving the\nrecommendation but the Investment Adviser has to evaluate the fund properly and if this\ndoes not seem suitable for a client then it has to be avoided. Many times, relationship\nmanagers also push aggressive products like unit linked insurance plans or equity mutual\nfunds to older people even when this is not suitable. These too have to be evaluated based\non the need and situation of the client and avoided when not needed.\n\n\n## 371",

This could well\ngive rise to different solutions that might not have been thought of before. This could be the\nbreakthrough that helps solve the dilemma.\n\n\n# Nowadays, in today's digital world and proliferation of social media, there are many kinds of\nviews and opinions floating around on investment products, both ethical and unethical. The\nclient can easily come across those views and talk to the adviser for clarity. Justification is part\nof the job of the adviser. Hence ethical behaviour is an imperative.\n\n\n## 19.5 Fiduciary responsibility of Investment Advisers\n\n\n## Investment Advisers are fiduciaries, which means that they have to act in the best interest of\ntheir clients. This is the central part of the entire fiduciary responsibility of the Investment\nAdvisers. There are chances that several conflicts of interest may arise during the course of\ntheir work but the fiduciary responsibility is to rise above all this and ensure that the client is\nalways put at the forefront of any step that has been taken.\n\n\n## The investment adviser is a person that acts on behalf of another person to manage their\nfinancial assets. This means that there has to be a principle of utmost good faith (uberrimae\nfidei principle in Latin) and trust that needs to be followed. There cannot be profit made at\nthe cost of the client and this has to be followed at all times. What this means is that the\nadviser must not take unfair advantage of the client's trust. This is at the heart of the fiduciary\nduty to their clients.\n\n\n## There are several obligations that would be required to be fulfilled by the Investment Adviser\nwhen they are dealing with their clients.\n\n\n## Full Disclosure of all the facts has to be made to the client. There cannot be any omission of\ndetails. This not only covers not giving wrong information but it means that the correct\ninformation should have been disclosed. Not disclosing the facts might lead to the client being\nmisled and this has to be avoided. Such a disclosure is absolutely essential when there is a\nconflict of interest. Disclosures should also be done when there can be a perception of conflict\nof interest, so that trust and faith is maintained at all times.\n\n\n## There has to be suitable advice that is given to the client. The exact requirements of each\nindividual client will vary and the investment adviser has to give advice that would be right in\na specific situation for a specific person. This will require the proper study of the necessary\nconditions that are relevant for a particular client.\n\n\n## In addition, there has to be a reasonable basis or objective basis for the recommendation.\nThe manner in which the recommendation is formed by the investment adviser becomes\nimportant. It should not be based on factors that benefit the adviser. This is essential for the\nclient to get the advice that they require for the purpose of meeting their financial goals.\n\n\n## 372",

(This is all the more important due\nto the proliferation of finfluencers, who claim to be investment experts, but are not\nauthorized by SEBI.)\n- Check for SEBI registration number. Please refer to the list of all SEBI registered Investment\nAdvisers which is available on SEBI website in the following link:\n\nhttps://www.sebi.gov.in/sebiweb/other/OtherAction.do?doRecognisedFpi=yes&intmld=13)\n\n- Ensure that the Investment Adviser has a valid registration certificate.\n- Pay only advisory fees to your Investment Adviser. Make payments of advisory fees through\nbanking channels only and maintain duly signed receipts mentioning the details of your\npayments.\n- Always ask for your risk profiling before accepting investment advice. Insist that Investment\nAdviser provides advisory strictly on the basis of your risk profiling and takes into account\navailable investment alternatives.\n- Ask all relevant questions and clear your doubts with your Investment Adviser before acting\non advice.\n- Assess the risk-return profile of the investment as well as the liquidity and safety aspects\nbefore making investments.\n- Insist on getting the terms and conditions in writing duly signed and stamped. Read these\nterms and conditions carefully particularly regarding advisory fees, advisory plans, category\nof recommendations etc. before dealing with any Investment Adviser.\n- Be vigilant in your transactions.\n- Approach the appropriate authorities for redressal of your doubts / grievances. Inform\nSEBI about Investment Advisers offering assured or guaranteed returns.\n\n\n## Don'ts for Investors\n\n- Do not deal with unregistered entities. The implication is, do not go by the number of\nfollowers on social media.\n- Don't fall for stock tips offered under the pretext of investment advice.\n- Do not give your money for investment to the Investment Adviser.\n- Don't fall for the promise of indicative or exorbitant or assured returns by the Investment\nAdvisers. Don't let greed overcome rational investment decisions.\n- Don't get carried away by luring advertisements or market rumours.\n- Avoid doing transactions only on the basis of phone calls or messages from any Investment\nAdviser or its representatives.\n- Don't take decisions just because of repeated messages and calls by Investment Advisers.\n\n\n## 373",

This is\nto be conducted by a Practising Chartered Accountant. An advisor should disclose to clients if\nthere are any material audit observations.\n\n\n# 19.8 Global Best Practices\n\n\n# Globally various regulators as well as other associations put a premium on ethical behaviour\nby their members and those that they supervise. Across the world there are several different\nguidelines, that are in force but some of them have several common features too. Here is a\n\n\n## look at a few of these practices.\n\n\n## 19.8.1 Securities and Exchange Commission US\n\n\n# The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)^{33} in the US requires a registered adviser to\ndisclose to clients and prospective clients, information about a financial condition that would\nimpair the ability of the adviser to meet contractual commitments to clients and even certain\ndisciplinary events of the adviser within the past 10 years that are materially important. The\nSEC requires each adviser to adopt and implement written policies for this regard. These\nshould identify conflicts and other compliance factors creating risk and then address these\n\n\n## risks.\n\n\n## Code of Ethics: All advisers registered with the SEC must adopt and enforce a written code of\nethics reflecting the adviser's fiduciary duties to its clients. At a minimum, the adviser's code\n\n\n# of ethics must:\n\n- Standards of Conduct. Set forth a minimum standard of conduct for all supervised persons;\n- Compliance with Federal Securities Laws. Require supervised persons to comply with\n\n\n## federal securities laws;\n\n- Personal Securities Transactions. Require each of an adviser's access persons to report his\nsecurities holdings at the time that the person becomes an access person and at least once\nannually thereafter and to make a report at least once quarterly of all personal securities\n\n33 https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/ia2256.htm#:~:text=The%20Commission%20is%20adopting%20new,compliance%20wit\nh%20federal%20securities%20laws.(it is a good practice to add 'date accessed' for web links)\n\n\n## 374",

In brief, these are:\n\n- To identify the client's financial situation, objectives and needs.\n- To identify the subject matter of the advice sought by the client (whether explicitly or\nimplicitly).\n- To identify the client's relevant circumstances - the objectives, financial situation and needs\nthat would reasonably be considered as relevant to advice sought on that subject matter.\n- To ensure this information is complete and correct; enquiries should be made if gaps or\n\n\n## inconsistencies are apparent.\n\n- When considering the advice sought, whether it would be reasonable to consider\nrecommending a financial product; if it is deemed relevant, they should only recommend a\nproduct after thoroughly investigating the most appropriate products relevant to the client's\n\n\n## circumstances.\n\n\n## 34http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol act/ca2001172/s961b.html\n\n\n## 375",

Regulations provide various mechanisms for the investors to\naddress any grievance they may have with respect to their dealings. This may be to do with\nthe accuracy and extent of information or advice related to a product or service, fees or\nexpenses or penalty charged in any form or name, or a situation when a request for a service\nrelated to a financial product was delayed or even unattended. The first line of action for the\ninvestor is to approach the product or service provider concerned to get the grievance\nresolved. If it is not resolved to the investor's satisfaction, they can approach the regulator of\nthe respective industry.\n\n\n# 20.3Grievance Redress System\n\n\n# A robust grievance recording and redress system ensures that the investor is able to get their\nproblems addressed in a timely manner. Some of the features of a robust system cover the\nfollowing:\n\n\n## Source of receipt of complaint\n\n\n## Complaints have to arise from relevant issues that are covered under the acts or regulations\nrelated to an investor like SEBI Act, Securities Contract Regulation Act, Depositories Act and\nrules and regulation made there under and relevant provisions of Companies Act, 2013. This\nensures that the right complaints are addressed.\n\n\n## Date and time of receipt of complaint\n\n\n## The complaint has to be received within a specific time period mentioned in the relevant acts.\nThis ensures that the system is not clogged with old complaints which might be difficult to\ndispose of. A balance has to be maintained in terms of the time period for which complaints\nwill be entertained.\n\n\n## Nature of complaint\n\n\n## The complaint has to be relevant so these have to fall into the definition of being a complaint.\nThis is necessary so that frivolous complaints can be eliminated and the relevant ones are\ngiven the required importance.\n\nWhether it could be resolved internally or to be escalated to an external entity\n\n\n## A robust system will have a clear path that a complaint has to follow. Normally the first port\nof landing for the complaint is the internal system of the entity against whom the complaint\n\n\n## is made and it is then escalated to an outside agency. This ensures that there is a chance given\nfor the complaint to be addressed at the source.\n\n\n## 378",

The BCSBI has published the \"Code of Banks' Commitments to Customers\n“which sets minimum standards of banking practice and benchmarks in customer service for\nbanks to follow.\n\n\n## Most banks are members of the BCSBI and have thus voluntarily adopted the Code as their\nFair Practice Code in dealings with their customers.\n\n\n## Each bank has a customer redressal department that handles issues that customers have\nagainst the bank. Customers can file complaints with this department. If customer is not\nsatisfied with the response, he can approach banking ombudsmen, appointed by Reserve\nBank of India in various locations across the country.\n\n\n# 20.6.2 Integrated Ombudsman Scheme\n\n\n## The Banking Ombudsman is a person appointed by the RBI to address the complaints of\nbanking customers related to the services offered by banks. They also hear complaints related\nto credit cards issued by banks and Non-banking Finance Companies (NBFCs).\n\n\n## The Integrated Ombudsman Scheme serves as the redressal forum for a complaint against\nthe services of a bank for receipt and payment of funds to and from the holder's account.\nDisputes related to interest charged or credited, penalty or fees charged, disputes related to\nATM cards, debit cards and credit cards, issues of refusing a loan without valid reasons and\nothers may also be referred to the ombudsman.\n\n\n## 381",
